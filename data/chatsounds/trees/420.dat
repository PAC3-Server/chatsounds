trailer but didnt play well in the game instead of the slow build we decided to send dog straight into action he makes a grand entrance jumps on the strider and the fight is on the quick start helps

green texturing of these caves provided a couple of significant challenges we had never made such a large scale area completely out of displacements before the convoluted topology of the surfaces made them especially hard to uv map without unpleasantlooking seams and texture warping after some early attempts we decided that we were not going to be able to map this area using conventional uvmapping so we decided to write custom shaders especially for the caves our custom shader combines multiple axisaligned projections based upon the surface normal this largely fixed our problems with stretching and seams since we wanted to provide dramatic lighting in these areas particularly when lit by the flashlight we augmented the source engines radiosity bumpmapping with a new piece of technology this allows us to create a form of bumpmaps in which the bumpmapped surface details actually cast soft shadows across the surface this emphasizes the surface bumpiness especially when the light is at grazing

well as its specific cry for help it can be hard to tweak the sounds so hard while still giving an organic quality to the voice to design a sound that contained a sense of the alien personality without just sounding like another animal call we found a way to add and process overtones while subtly altering the phrasing of the pitch the resulting sounds give the impression that the vorts are

the soundscape to have the deadened internalized quality you get from putting your hands over your ears so we started with recordings from inside a womb if you listen closely you can hear internal gurgling noises as well as muffled heartbeats we then added various other effects around the rythym of the heartbeat plus long tailed reverb none of the door or transition effects are literal

adds a visual point of interest to the area and also blocks direct line of site into the nearby corridor without blocking the space itself these effects can be placed and controlled within levels attached to animation events of characters or called by code allowing particles to be attached to objects in the world emitted from a models hitboxes and locked to bone positions allows for them to serve a variety of functions such as the new vortigaunt beams or the burning effect of a zombie we hope this feature will allow level and mod authors to create a wide variety of effects quickly and

dalton we had wanted to implement a generalized particle system for quite some time and after episode we set out to create one in previous half life games each effect had been hand coded by a programmer working with an artist it was effective but not easily scalable our new system drew upon the aspects we found most useful from team members who had worked with both realtime systems in games and offline renders for movies such as the lord of the rings the results were an artist friendly modular component driven system each system can have renderers which display the particle in some form initializers which set up certain properties of the particle operators which carry out actions upon the particle each frame constraints which provide movement limitations such as collision forces which impart complex dynamics and emitters which determine how new particles are created together they are plugged into a system as needed to be as lightweight or as complex as required for the effect each individual component is simple but when combined can create rather complex dynamics furthermore adding additional components to support the specific needs of a game or mod is easily done the results can be seen in everything ranging from the simple glows of the larval extract here to citadel effects blood smoke hunter effects portal effects fire and so forth dynamic effects are now in the hands of the artists who can use them to create whatever is neededfrom unique oneoffs in specific levels to generalized effects for

this it shouldnt surprise me by now because ive been working on alyx for so long now but every time we come to the table to do a new scene or to lay down some new material i am always blown away and this scene was the epitome of that feeling i was so pumped to get in there and start working on it theyre always upping the ante and always taking it to the next level but this time this scene is different cause this time alyx loses and i think this is ai dont think it is a major sacrifice you see her carrying around the wounds of her mother that she lost but her dad made her who she is her dad taught her her dad groomed her and i think most importantlyhe loved her this script was a gift and a gutpunch all in one when you give me something like that it really motivates me to try to knock

dandridge a question i get asked a lot is what is the big difference between acting for stage and film and then acting for a videogame because this is the first time ive ever done a videogame in general in acting its helpful to have a directors clear vision from which to spring then the actor can run with the idea play with it imagine new things fill it out and make it a tangible thing or a tangible character and the great thing about videogame acting for me is that im completely unlimited im not bound by what i can do physically or how i look or what kind of environment can be physically created so the possibilities are completely limitless there are no boundaries with this so when we get together and we talk about what the scene is when they set the stage for me and what environment im going to be in i immediately get a complete high and i can only imagine it is something like how somebody gets when they actually see the game because it blows my mind the pictures that they paint about where we are what situations were in so we discuss that a little and then from there we just kind of go on i guess instinct is the only way i can really describe it because i take what they give to me and kind of volley it back in the way that it comes out immediately so i just go into my little dark booth and i can imagine that im anywhere and its the bestthe best kind of

see an immense piece of the environment transformed before their eyes the bridge collapse not only showcases the cinematic physics it reminds players of the growing threat from the superportal and

objects directly toward the player at high speeds these objects were really hard to dodge and if you werent paying complete attention you could easily be blindsided and killed the guards now hurl objects along an arcing trajectory which not only gives the player a greater opportunity to dodge but looks awesome the player gets to see the guard launch a car from a hundred feet away then step

balance the damaged bridge was left in as a result the structural deformation of the twisted metal was modeled with the help of surface based spring networks driven by particle systems in this case we actually passed a rail car through the bridge and solved the deformation dynamically for the collapse we used an offline large scale rigid body simulation a technology typically reserved for the visual effects industry in this simulation we have about moving parts calculated with coarse convex hulls these in turn drove a skeleton network to which the high resolution geometry was skinned

beyond the basics of gravity and collisions we created spiral vortices gravity wells and some other more complex forces with over individually calculated dynamic moving parts over a second period this

the bottom of the shaft while dr kleiner lectured them about rockets and satellites they wandered into a control room to watch dr mossmans transmission and then hatched a plan to get her back we knew we were in trouble when even the authors of the scene were bored and no one had patience for the revelations that followed we divided the sequence into a number of smaller pieces that could be interleaved with solitary exploration and some combat this required rebuilding the path and moving the control room upstairs where the transmission scene became a reward for surviving the secondary silo as a result of these changes the white forest experience is more varied the narrative comes in digestible portions and players are able to play at their own speed rather than being led by the

boss battle but without physics and explosives theres no way to kill the guardian they would empty all their ammunition into him and die horribly over and over before giving up and running away they hated it our first solution to this problem was to add an arena immediately before the maze where we hoped players would use up most of their ammo on headcrabs and barnacles and not even try to shoot him but clever players managed to lure the headcrabs into barnacles and rush past while the barnacle was feeding arriving in the guardians lair with plenty of ammunition and again with a false impression that they could kill the boss in the end it was necessary to have the vortigaunt tell the player remember do not kill the guardian or the extract will be ruinedtherefore justifying why you wouldnt be able to do we didnt want you to do and what you couldnt do in the first place this area is really fun now the battle is almost exactly like the original layout the big difference is that were communicating our expectations to the player rather than having them learn by

casali to create a climactic finish to this level we ramped up strider density and citizen presence and then systematically destroyed outer installations in order to move the action as uncomfortably close to the base as possible it was important to us that everyone be able to play to the end of the episode but we also wanted them to feel that defeating the striders required a heroic effort a balance had to be achieved between the feeling of being overwhelmed and the possibility of completing the level we made many tradeoffs to keep the experience enjoyable while keeping the intensity high and sometimes this required removing enemies for example elite combine soldiers originally took part in this invasion running in and around the striders and hunters but this additional level of enemy

maggiore the barn scene was critical both to this episode and to the development of advisors as characters in the series they represent another intersection of story and gameplay concerns this is the first time the player actually interacts with an advisor and determining the right level of interactivity was tricky especially given the players reasonable expectation that hell get to fight them directly at some point therefore we wanted to show that they were powerful but not invulnerable this was a longterm goal for the short term we wanted to get the player familiar with some advisor behavior so that when the episode finale occurred they would already understand how advisors operate by showing the advisor fumbling with an inert object then a dead rebel and finally grabbing the player we allow the player to observe behavior and then gradually make it more and more of a direct threat this all serves as foreshadowing for the episodes

maggiore the scene where alyx sees the hunters for the first time since her injury was meant to be a turning point for her as a character and an emotional highlight of the episode both for gordon and for alyx one reason we had a hunter injure alyx in the beginning of the episode was so that she could have a strong emotional reaction to the creatures and use the start of combat as a way of building a good character moment alyxs previous encounter has given her a visceral fear of hunters but now she has to make a conscious choice to get past her fear and into the right state for fighting them she uses anger to get there we also use alyxs intensity to draw the players attention to subtler aspects of the scenegetting the player in position for the best view of the hunters as the attack gets

gehrig having decided that we were going to rely on a car to get to white forest we had to figure out how to get alyx into the vehicle games often accomplish this by moving their characters close to the vehicle and then teleporting them inside in a very visible and jarring manner we knew this would ruin alyxs believability as a character so she had to smoothly get into a vehicle the way you would expect a person to in real life this was no small task given all the strange angles and positions the player could work the vehicle into alyx also needed multiple entries into a vehicle given that the doorway she wanted to use could be blocked or otherwise inaccessible this also provided interesting moments for alyx where she could vault over the hood of the vehicle in a very heroic fashion the interaction between her and the vehicle was intriguing just by itself once we were sure she could enter and exit the vehicle convincingly we then had the task of making her believable as she sat next to you our first experiments revolved around alyx reacting to the physical nature of the vehicle when it crashed into a wall she needed to be jolted when you went around a bend she needed to lean with the momentum of the car these details were crucial in making her feel like she was really going along for the bumpy ride with you we also wanted her to be very aware of her surroundings and what the player was doing while in the vehicle if you ran over a zombie she needed to echo the internal reward the player felt for accomplishing the feat if you were about to hit the wall we wanted her to flinch and react to the impending collision much as the player at home would be doing there was a fine balance between making her too much of a backseat driver or having her be too quiet next to you ultimately we wanted alyxs presence in the vehicle to seem so natural that players would never consider it anything other than normal¤this¥vista¢is£one¢of£the§largest¤open§outdoor¥areas¤weve§tackled¢in£our¥games¤when©rendering¤such¢an¤area¢in¤real¤time£its©necessary¢to£use§various­levelofdetailªtechniques¤made©available¢to¢us¢by£the¦source¦engine£for§example£the§distant§foliage£and§combine§enemies£are¨rendered¤with£far¥fewer¨polygons¤than¤they¥would¢be¢if¤they¤were¥meant¢to¢be¦viewed¢up¥close¬additionally£the§organic¦shapes¤used¢to¥model£the¥rocky¬outcroppings£and¦valley¥floor¥below£use§complex§shadingªoperations¢to§combine¡aªrelatively¦modest¦amount¢of§texture¤data¤this¨tradeoff¥which¨requires¡aªmanageable¦amount¢of§texture¤data¦allows¢us¢to£use¤more¨polygons¨enabling¢us¢to©represent¤more§organic¦shapes¥which£are¢in¨contrast¢to£theªorthogonal¥forms¦common¢to£our«traditional¥urban¬environmentsªSOUND_DATA‚¦realmsªcommentary‚¦sounds‘¤pathÙ#sound/commentary/ep2-comment095.wav¥realmªcommentary§triggerÚkathy gehrig this vista is one of the largest open outdoor areas weve tackled in our games when rendering such an area in real time its necessary to use various levelofdetail techniques made available to us by the source engine for example the distant foliage and combine enemies are rendered with far fewer polygons than they would be if they were meant to be viewed up close additionally the organic shapes used to model the rocky outcroppings and valley floor below use complex shading operations to combine a relatively modest amount of texture data this tradeoff which requires a manageable amount of texture data allows us to use more polygons enabling us to represent more organic shapes which are in contrast to the orthogonal forms common to our traditional urban

joshua weier the antlion experience in half life was characterized by a mindless constant onslaught of bugs rushing your way we devised the antlion worker for episode as a way to add depth and variety to the underground sequences by leveraging new types of gameplay unlike normal antlions the worker chooses to avoid direct confrontation skulking in the background and lobbing acidic globs from a distance this extends the amount of time players spend with each creature by contrast an encounter with an ordinary antlion is over in seconds the spitting behavior was derived from the bullsquid of half life but was updated to fit the more physical world of half life to that end the spit globs are not merely sprites but physically simulated objects flying through the air along realistic

weier the striderbuster or magnusson device started life as a half life weapon called the hopwire this was a weapon that would leap into the air and create physical connections via ropes to the surface around it once attached the ball would be suspended in the air ready for action we never shipped that weapon because it wasnt generally useable enough in our environments especially outdoors one side experiment created the black hole hopwire that the mod community found in episode s code you can still find videos of this in action on you tube the black hole version created a true physical vortex that sucked anything near it into an incredibly dense singularity this created a small dense block comprised of all the mass and matter the vortex had collected which the player could then pick up and hurl at enemies we returned to the hopwire for episode where we thought we could use it to tie the striders legs together and make it trip but the mechanic of hurling and attaching the strider buster was more fun for players so we moved the weapon in that

caldwell initially we built this area around the sandtraps mechanic from half life warning the player that stepping on sand would trigger swarms of antlions soon after the warning however the safe islands of rock ran out and the player was forced to run across the sand as quickly as possible players were confused by this and upset because alyx and the vortigaunt would simply say they had no choice and head straight across the sand to solve this we decided to stage the combat with safe zones around thumpers

leonard one issue with a number of our encounters with the combine is that they dont live long enough for players to experience some of their more interesting ai some unique elements introduced here with respect to the combine are branching assaults so that soldiers introduced to the field dont take up predictable positions flexible assault points so that soldiers can stray from designer specified locations to establish line of fire or cover assault progression is a feedback system so that the timing of the soldiers advances responds to player actions and skill rather than timing we give soldiers different tactical roles for instance squads in the field distract the player allowing other soldiers to execute surprise moves not present in our typical frontal assault scenarios the net effect of these changes is that the soldiers are perceived to have awareness of the layout of the building that youre trapped in and a strategy for flushing you

swarms we found this left players unsure of their defensive strategies and would force them to visually survey the cavern before setting up defenses so we made the two characters stronger and had them yell out their state to players and even suggest what openings the player should cover this gave players extra time to setup a defensive strategy before the antlions arrived this also let us also rachet up the intensity level by slowly heightening their reactions to the threats once we realized this worked we decided to separate the characters and create an abbott and costello style team to do

it now flexes and slides around more a lot of this stuff you wont even notice itll just look right yeah thats alyx shes wearing a jacket you wont even think about it its easy to have the computer draw something stiff and awkward but doing that pulls you out of the game you stop believing in the characters they just become icons our goal is to make our characters simply look natural but to do that

they dont have to worry about replaying more of the game than necessary in playtests we observed that most players depended on our autosaves to restart after dying rather than using their own quicksaves but because the fight allowed players so much freedom some players ended up with an autosave that left them in a nowin situation low on health and pinned down by hunters or too far from the base to defend the rocket in time some players failed thirty or more times before finally giving up to address the nowin situation we extended our autosave system to monitor health over time and to only perform the autosave if the player was deemed safe for a reasonable period of time we also prohibited autosaves when striders were within a certain distance of the base this ensured there was

sawyer weve gotten better at building combat spaces that are open and tactically versatile while still directing the player toward an optimal play experience this combat is on its face pretty straightforward but were doing some subtle things to keep the experience even and well paced were using quite a few of our combat tools in this one scene as the first soldiers enter the barn we send them in the right direction with an initial cue about the players location using an npc enemyfinder the first soldiers serve primarily to draw the player outwards where the real meat of the combat takes place the wave of soldiers that spawns as the player rounds the corner to the exit are the most directly controlled one pair uses assault points to dash across the open ground and flank the player on the right others are constrained to hint groups in and around the house across the way spaced so that the player is hit with an even front of fire keeping them pinned for a while and encouraging cautious sniping and probing at the windows and doors the hint groups are important because they keep the soldiers in strong tactical positions and prevent them from rushing the player to their own disadvantage as they would if left unconstrained the broken down truck gives a vital bit of midground cover as players leave the barn and advance on the house finally as the player leaves the barn we spawn the reinforcing hunter we hold this back both to keep the difficulty more even and because the hunter combat is better when the player has pushed outwards before it

striders initially referred to compass directions which most players couldnt follow because they couldnt remember which way was north we added white forest peak as a global landmark and distinctive local landmarks like the cranes and the water tower and referred to those landmarks in the announcements instead of compass directions this helped but some players still had a hard time knowing which

the catwalk rather than activating the switch from the ground the van entrance discourages players from bringing in objects they might use to solve the puzzle by stacking the lone grenade crate is a
