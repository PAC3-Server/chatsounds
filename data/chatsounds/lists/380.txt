sound/vo/episode_1/intro/kl_fellowcitizens12.wav=however this is most likely a temporary state of affairs as we once learned to our dismay even the relatively tiny fracture at black mesa gave our enemies an opening which they were able to force ever wider as they poured through in greater and greater numbers
sound/vo/episode_1/intro/kl_fellowcitizens03.wav=i repeat you must evacuate the city at once
sound/vo/episode_1/intro/kl_imsorryeli01.wav=im sorry eli but i dont see any other way
sound/vo/episode_1/intro/kl_hopeyoufar.wav=oh alyx my dear i do hope you are far far away from the citadel
sound/vo/episode_1/intro/kl_fellowcitizens25.wav=let me just add to all those who can hear me now as we struggle out of the shadow of our malefactors welcome back to the light
sound/vo/episode_1/intro/kl_fellowcitizens24.wav=this has been dr isaac kleiner formerly of black mesa now simply a citizen like all of you of earth
sound/vo/episode_1/intro/kl_fellowcitizens26.wav=now where did i put that calculator
sound/vo/episode_1/intro/kl_imsorryeli02.wav=it would help us evacuate more citizens
sound/vo/episode_1/intro/kl_fellowcitizens11.wav=in short the combine are completely cut off combine forces currently stationed on earth are now isolated units stranded
sound/vo/episode_1/intro/kl_fellowcitizens18.wav=we place our firmest hope in the human spirit even knowing how easily it may be shattered we have all seen friends and family crushed by the combine some of our neighbors have allowed themselves to be coopted and purged of their humanity by the military machine
sound/vo/episode_1/intro/kl_fellowcitizens01.wav=fellow citizens residents of city and environs by which i mean sentient residents of course human and otherwise although i believe there is little need to explain recent developments to our vortigaunt allies
sound/vo/episode_1/intro/kl_fellowcitizens04.wav=while there was certainly a great benefit in destroying the citadels teleport core we have detected one rather unfortunate side effect
sound/vo/episode_1/intro/kl_noquestion03.wav=we are rapidly approaching the point of no return
sound/vo/episode_1/intro/kl_fellowcitizens20.wav=still i cannot overstate how important it is that we retain our humanity only this will allow us to hold together as we must for their inevitable return and what is certain to be unimaginable retaliation
sound/vo/episode_1/intro/kl_fellowcitizens17.wav=for what the combine fear the most is not any tangible human weapon but our will our intellect our ability to respond selectively and rationally to every terror they turn against us
sound/vo/episode_1/intro/kl_fellowcitizens05.wav=it would appear an inevitability that very soon now the citadel will be consumed in a destructive event whose magnitude i cannot currently estimate with any certainty except to say that it will almost certainly irradiate an area of many miles radius
sound/vo/episode_1/intro/kl_fellowcitizens16.wav=we continue to diligently assemble and train a new generation of scientists and technicians
sound/vo/episode_1/intro/kl_fellowcitizens19.wav=and those who resisted have met a most terrible fate
sound/vo/episode_1/intro/kl_fellowcitizens06.wav=therefore i repeat evacuate city at once if not sooner i cannot state this without enough undue emphasis
sound/vo/episode_1/intro/kl_citadelabove02.wav=alyx is well out of harms way by now
sound/vo/episode_1/intro/kl_fellowcitizens22.wav=i apologize for any inadvertent errors or omissions as you can imagine we have had scarcely time to record let alone rehearse
sound/vo/episode_1/intro/kl_fellowcitizens13.wav=in addition to the completely xenotheric species there are many modified posthuman allies still remaining on earth who will be doing their utmost to reestablish lines of communication and supply with the larger forces
sound/vo/episode_1/intro/kl_damage01.wav=the manner in which these exceedingly rare quantum effects percolate up into the physical plane will be fascinating to witness
sound/vo/episode_1/intro/kl_isthison.wav=ahem is this on yes very well i i am not much of a public speaker but ill ill do my best
sound/vo/episode_1/intro/kl_carefullamarr02.wav=these lamps are quite hot
sound/vo/episode_1/intro/kl_vicinity.wav=anyone left in the vicinity will be subjected to energetic events whose effects are beyond my powers of speculation
sound/vo/episode_1/intro/kl_fellowcitizens09.wav=since this is in fact the first opportunity we have had to speak openly of the baleful influence of the combine there is much ground to coverand in fact i hope to institute a series of useful bulletins in the days ahead however for now we will have to content ourselves with some relatively meager exposition
sound/vo/episode_1/intro/kl_fellowcitizens02.wav=at any rate first as a matter of great urgency if you find yourself still within the confines of city you are well advised to leave the city at once by the fastest means available to you we have restored service to much of the commuter transport system in order to carry citizens out of the city as quickly as possible we have also established camps and triage areas in the surrounding environs
sound/vo/episode_1/intro/kl_fellowcitizens21.wav=and oh yes if you missed any part of this message it will loop repeatedly until there is no point in looping it any longer
sound/vo/episode_1/intro/kl_fellowcitizens23.wav=whats that eli oh right
sound/vo/episode_1/intro/kl_noquestion01.wav=theres no question that it will im afraid
sound/vo/episode_1/intro/kl_damage04.wav=although i suppose we really should send a foray party for specimens at some point after the event
sound/vo/episode_1/intro/kl_fellowcitizens10.wav=the destabilization of the city reactor has had repercussions that were not entirely unexpected although we hardly dared speak this hope ahead of time the destructive pulse forced a damper on the entire network of linked citadel reactors thus for the time being i believe that all combine portals have failed completely as well as all communication systems based on that technology
sound/vo/episode_1/intro/kl_carefullamarr01.wav=careful lamarr
sound/vo/episode_1/intro/kl_damage03.wav=the ravages to cellular material are unimaginable
sound/vo/episode_1/intro/kl_damage02.wav=however not at first hand
sound/vo/episode_1/intro/kl_fellowcitizens07.wav=on a lighter note if you are already in one of our designated safe zones i feel obliged to point out that a more fortunate sideeffect of the reactors destruction is the complete removal of the combines reproductive suppression field
sound/vo/episode_1/intro/kl_noquestion02.wav=our remote sensors indicate the process is accelerating toward a darkenergy flare
sound/vo/episode_1/intro/kl_citadelabove01.wav=oh dear eli im sorry but surely theres no need for undue alarm
sound/vo/episode_1/intro/kl_fellowcitizens08.wav=previously certain protein chains important to the process of embryonic development were selectively prevented from forming this is no longer the case for those so inclined now would be an excellent time for procreation which is to say in laymans terms you should give serious consideration to doing your part for the revival of the species we must make the most of the time we have as it is by no means certain how much time we have secured ourselves before the combine attempt to restore their dominion as they certainly shall
sound/vo/episode_1/intro/kl_fellowcitizens14.wav=even so there is greater reason for hope now than at any time in the past decade
sound/vo/episode_1/intro/kl_fellowcitizens15.wav=we have made in secret several technological advances which we will do our best to deploy in advance of the combines return
sound/vo/episode_1/intro/kl_insufficient.wav=what oh dear but theres really no time the core is exceedingly close to collapse why theres no way to get far enough without first well nothing short of a direct intervention in the core could possibly retard the reaction

realm=commentary
sound/commentary/artgameplaystandards.wav=ted backman our art and gameplay standards encourage players to build a visual dictionary that defines how they expect things to work in the half life world for instance even though the door to the powerbox room is metal and would probably have a metal crossbar holding it shut we barred it with a wooden plank because weve been consistent throughout the game the player should recognize that a wooden plank can be both broken and manipulated with the gravity gun properties that wouldnt be immediately apparent about a metal bar
sound/commentary/finalcontrolroompuzzle.wav=scott dalton the goal of this logic puzzle isnt figuring out that you need to put balls in the batteries its coming to the realization that by filling all of them youve denied yourself an exit and that you have to desocket one climb on the lift and then resocket it sparks guide the player to the source of the balls which happens to be the tube they just passed through
sound/commentary/burrowblocking.wav=john guthrie this three level parking garage is where the antlion burrow training pays off because weve taught the player the burrow blocking mechanic earlier in a less hectic environment the problem here becomes not what to do with the burrows but where to find the cars to block them while fighting off a horde of antlions the burrows themselves went through several iterations at first playtesters had a hard time seeing them and once theyd pushed a car onto one they often werent sure if the hole was actually sealed we eventually solved both of these problems by adding a particle effect to the burrows this effect makes them recognizable even at a distance and its absence is a clear indication that a burrow is blocked
sound/commentary/silhouette.wav=ken birdwell rappelling soldiers presented a difficult training problem because weve found that its tough to focus the players attention upward this entire alley was carefully designed to ensure that the player would see the descending soldiers first we framed the soldiers with a straight line of buildings then we had them run across the rooftops so that they were starkly silhouetted against the sky before they dropped down in front of lightly colored buildings finally we added a distinctive sound to the rappelling action so that players would recognize it later in the game
sound/commentary/zombinemusic.wav=kelly bailey the soundtrack here was created for the introduction of a new adversary the combine zombie or zombine dischordant guitar tones and bends and a lowfi fast beat work in the background of this encounter to create an off balance and disturbing mood
sound/commentary/hospitalart.wav=randy lundeen the hospital was a completely new interior space that we had to design pretty much from scratch like most of city s visuals it was inspired by eastern european architecture the surgery lamps and the overall white and yellow color scheme were drawn from photos of a hospital in chernobyl the tile work and the high archways were chosen to give the area the institutional feel of an old european hospital and the beds were based on some old world war images in fact we avoided modernlooking fixtures and furniture altogether in order to differentiate the place from a contemporary hospital
sound/commentary/crashedstalkercar.wav=matt t wood we wanted the crashed train car to be very disorienting in early tests though players felt that it was too confusing and too hard to navigate that feedback prompted us to tone it down a bit by rearranging some of the geometry we were able to create a banged up tilted environment that still offered a relatively unobstructed path to alyx
sound/commentary/kleinercast.wav=marc laidlaw one thing we try to do when were integrating storytelling and gameplay something that has become a hallmark of ours is to include nonlinear bits of narrative things that actionoriented players dont have to sit through but that are available to players who want to learn more about the background of the story kleiners broadcasts on the public address monitors are a good example of this method apart from the strong visual image of dr kleiner replacing his former boss on the giant screens his speech conveys a lot of dense information about the state of the world and how things have changed due to the events of half life we settled on this particular location for the kleinercast as one of the few logical places where players can watch it in peace or move on to the next encounter its essentially a footnote embedded in the world which makes this a footnote on a footnote
sound/commentary/separatefromalyx.wav=ido magal we separate alyx from the player here to make the strider battle a more intimate combat experience while we generally want alyx to be useful to the player bosses tend to require a specific combat style to beat and weve found that it usually doesnt make gameplay sense to keep her around plus boss battles are the players big hero moments and having too much help dilutes the sense of individual accomplishment alyx more or less sits out all of our boss encounters
sound/commentary/monitorscene.wav=bill fletcher monitor scenes are especially difficult to make interesting since they tend to involve literally just talking heads by interweaving critical expository information like how dangerous the citadel has become with some dramatic character interactions between alyx eli and dr kleiner we were able to convert a potential liability into one of the strongest scenes in the game a great way to illustrate characters relationships to each other is to have one of the characters in danger and show the others reactions to it which is what this scene is all about
sound/commentary/monsterintro.wav=adrian finol its important that monsters get very deliberate introductions since players are going to interact with them a lot generally we let the player first see a new monster in a safe environment so that they can start thinking about it before they have to fight it
sound/commentary/plausiblerepopulation.wav=ido magal we wrestled with the problem of plausibly repopulating this area with soldiers between each trip after several iterations we decided to have the soldiers jump in through some high windows this solution has several advantages beyond maintaining a credible fiction it makes the incoming enemies more immediately visible and since the windows are unreachable from the ground players arent able to exit through them plus leaping soldiers turn into tumbling ragdolls when shot which is always entertaining
sound/commentary/traincarmodel.wav=laura dubuk the train the player rides out of city had two major design goals it had to visually connect the end of episode one to the beginning of episode two and it also needed to address some functional gameplay requirements of the second episode using reference material wed collected on european train cars from the s we built a basic version of the train that level designers could test once we got the thumbsup from them we added textures and lots of little details the result is basically a caboose combined with rounder more streamlined elements from a passenger car
sound/commentary/alyxconsole.wav=matt t wood in an early version of this map alyx led the player through the whole thing to make alyx seem less omniscient we had her access a console here to get her bearings it exploded which helped drive home the point that the citadel was in bad shape but generally it was a long pause in the action without a lot of payoff after we made the high level decision to have alyx follow the player this entire scene became irrelevant and we happily cut the whole thing
sound/commentary/battleofreflexes.wav=steve bond we noticed during playtesting that players were often too afraid of the striders weapons to stand in front of it and fire rockets this was kind of a problem because rockets are virtually the only way to kill a strider to help players we modified the striders ai so that a playerlaunched rocket will significantly delay the striders attack this battle of reflexes lets players guide their missiles in safety as long as they get their shot off before the strider does
sound/commentary/likeablealyx.wav=erik wolpaw if you dont like alyx youre not going to have much fun with episode one so alyx being likeable was one of our most crucial design goals little moments like the zombine joke are designed to make alyx more endearing since we like to multitask it also had the practical purpose of introducing a new monster the success of the scene relied on a combination of dialog voice acting and animation surprisingly lighting was really important too under red light alyxs selfdeprecating groan looked more like she was sneering at the player for not getting the joke changing the lighting to blue and then adjusting the direction of the light so that it changed the shadows on her face fixed the problem
sound/commentary/vortexoflove.wav=matt t wood the primary goal of the first citadel map is to communicate to players that the citadel is falling apart the vortex was a late addition to the map in an effort to beef up the idea that the citadel was becoming a very dangerous place we had particular difficulty in conveying the danger zone here in early playtests players thought that the entire bridge was dangerous at all times some additional effects work helped let players know where the dangerous areas were we would have loved to base more gameplay on this vortex idea but we just didnt have the time
sound/commentary/alyxrunspeed.wav=doug wood there are some little practical details that take a surprising amount of time and testing to get just right for instance it took us many playtests to figure out how fast alyx should move it turns out that her following behavior looks and feels the best when shes moving faster than the players normal speed but slower than the players sprint speed
sound/commentary/weaponpickup.wav=jim dose before we armed players with traditional weapons we wanted to give them a chance to appreciate alyxs combat abilities toward that goal we created a very specific combat style for the early parts of the journey outside the citadel dark tense surrounded by zombies and either weaponless or starved for ammo so that players needed to rely on the gravity gun and more importantly alyx this is where players finally get a weapon since the door only opens when the padlock is shot players cant proceed without finding the pistol its effectively a weapon gate once players are through the door we can be sure theyve got a pistol
sound/commentary/stalkerball.wav=john guthrie here were presenting the player with a nowfamiliar ballsocket challenge but were also bridging into some new training showing the player that stalkers can destroy the combine energy balls
sound/commentary/dogmyhero.wav=bill fletcher players love dog so we made sure that he was the first thing you see when you wake up in episode one we also wanted players to get a glimpse of the crippled citadel when dog lifts you out of the rubble its one of the few instances in the game where we take control of the players view this allowed us to ensure the players view lingered briefly on the citadel before dog set them down
sound/commentary/hackingrollers.wav=matt t wood usually the second step of our training arcs involve a threatening training area this is the second step in the rollermine training and true to form theres a threat the indestructible rollermines endlessly attack the player in a gated space the only way to defeat them is to have alyx convert them which means theres no way the player can miss the point of the training players also like to see the ai characters fight each other so after reminding the player about alyxs rollermine hacking talent we let you sic them on a pack of combine soldiers
sound/commentary/holetraining.wav=jason deakins the antlion hole training is unusual because it requires the player to learn a new skill in combat this is a rare case where training occurs under duress so alyx states the problem and helps in the fight without giving away the solution
sound/commentary/alyxthekey.wav=chet faliszek in early versions of the episode alyx was much more vocal about giving the player hints however playtests showed it was much more satisfying for players when alyx stated a goal and then stepped aside until that goal was accomplished because of that feedback almost all of alyxs hint lines were cut eventually though we discovered through more playtesting that although players didnt like having alyx hand them unsolicited hints they did want to be able to explicitly request help from her we added some of the hint dialog back in but its only accessible at the players request by plususing alyx unfortunately we learned these hint lessons late in the development cycle and didnt have time to properly train players for this feature we plan to integrate the hintondemand dialog more thoroughly in future episodes
sound/commentary/c17vista.wav=gautam babbar this city vista is an explicit visual reward for surviving the elevator battle since early playtesters told us that we werent communicating just how damaged the city was this sweeping view of an extremely messed up city serves a practical purpose as well as being a nice moment of calm between storms the framing of your first view of the citadel in this vista space is very deliberate we included various leading elements such as wires and light poles that all drive the players eye to the citadel
sound/commentary/combinecorelook.wav=dhabih eng the combine core was another new space that needed to stand out from the rest of the environment we wanted the core to look hot and dangerous but still be distinct from the fires and the cool blues of the rest of the citadel the core became the primary light source in this space and in conjunction with the white set of combine materials we created an extreme contrast with the normally dark values of the citadel metals
sound/commentary/charactersys.wav=ken birdwell when we designed the half life facial system back in our goal was to get a natural looking performance at a moderate distance given our realtime polygon and texture budgets we chose fairly reserved or constrained performance over ever having the actors faces get into a bad looking or unnatural expression for episode one we wanted to extend the characters facial systems to support more intense performances with a wider range of facial expressions that would hold up better at close range these facial improvements included increasing the detail around the eyes and mouth increasing the number of facial shape targets think of these as movements of muscle groups by about rewriting the rules that control how these shapes blend and increasing the intensity of many of our existing shapes in addition we added support for controlling the amplitude of the facial movement for lipsync animation which let us dampen or amplify the mouth shapes based on the volume or intensity of the dialogue
sound/commentary/metalplates.wav=ido magal later in the level theres a combine gunner protected behind some metal plates just like the ones blocking the players way here we placed them here as a training tool to remind players that the gravity gun can grab and detach these things
sound/commentary/drawingattention.wav=brian jacobson this dropship scene was another case where we had to be clever about drawing the players attention to something cool that was about to happen which the player could easily miss if they werent looking in the right direction we used a solitary soldier firing at the player to draw their attention to where the dropship climbs into view once the player notices the dropship theres a good chance theyll watch it until the payoff when it crashes
sound/commentary/citylook.wav=randy lundeen the post half life look of city was difficult to nail down and went through many changes we wanted to establish several things primarily that this was a different part of the same city with a slightly different atmosphere and that it had been severely damaged this street was a test bed for a lot of our visual design work first we built an intact city street and then we beat up certain buildings in some cases removing them entirely so that more destruction was visible in the distance we did an initial lighting pass in the game engine and then took screenshots of various locations using photoshop we manipulated those screenshots to establish a color scheme photoshop lets us quickly iterate through all kinds of skies lighting styles and color schemes the environmental lighting colors that we ended up with were based on some photo references of the sun filtering through the smoke from a forest fire some falling ash effects and a closerthanusual fog plane helped sell the effect
sound/commentary/hdrcomment.wav=chris green episode one is our first project to use hdr lighting heavily in dark indoor environments the interaction between the flashlight and the autoexposure calculations done for hdr presented a real technical challenge in dark areas where the flashlight was the only source of illumination we found that wed often end up with grossly overexposed views we ended up compensating for this by using a different set of exposure parameters when the flashlight was turned on in particular we drastically shrunk the region of the screen examined for exposure calculations which permitted us to concentrate only on the much smaller area lit by the flashlight
sound/commentary/flares.wav=robin walker we always try to exploit a feature as much as possible throughout a game for instance these flares theyre an exploration reward theyve got a simple satisfying interaction with the gravity gun and theyre a good tactical alternative to the flashlight finally theyre a weapon that will ignite zombies which in turn become a new light source
sound/commentary/skybridgezombies.wav=ido magal players didnt have any weapons in the original version of this map that made it a lot more important to remove the boards with the gravity gun so that alyx could snipe the zombies once weapons were added though the skybridge became less of a puzzle and more of straightforward a combat event we added more zombies to increase the challenge but pulling the boards off is still the most fun way to get through this section
sound/commentary/justhavetodoit.wav=matt scott this area was redesigned several times in order to keep the player in this space while alyx delivers some exposition as much as we hated to do it the final solution was to have alyx climb out while the player looks for an alternate route we portray alyx as more athletic and nimble than gordon so the player shouldnt get too irritated by the fact that she can get to places they cant honestly were not especially happy with this crutch but its a tradeoff we sometimes have to make so that we can get alyx out of the way of interesting player challenges
sound/commentary/hospitalprops.wav=laura dubuk to make the set of empty corridors look like a hospital we chose some iconic hospital props that could be used multiple times throughout the level then we built the models with details multiple skins and vertical and horizontal elements that would be visually interesting in the space
sound/commentary/gunshipdesign.wav=scott dalton we designed this gunship battle to create a dynamic evolving experience while still keeping the player within a constrained area initially this space appears straightforward and provides plenty of cover as the environment gets progressively more damaged combat becomes more challenging players are increasingly open to enemy fire and the path to the rocket crate becomes more difficult to navigate as the roof breaks apart however the gunship also becomes more visible and therefore easier to hit keeping things relatively in balance the lighting in this area was tuned to play off of the hdr tonemapping effects between the dark inner spaces and the progressively open bright sky above
sound/commentary/foreshadowgunship.wav=gautam babbar whenever possible we like to foreshadow impending boss battles by introducing the enemy before the actual fight in this case you know youre going to be seeing that gunship again pretty soon
sound/commentary/citadel_skybox.wav=jay stelly the citadel is supposed to be a building of unprecedented scale so out of scale with the rest of the world in fact that we couldnt render it without our d skybox technology this technology allows us to build the citadel as a th scale model off in an unreachable corner of the map and seamlessly merge it into the scene we also use this technology to create the illusion of vast spaces and distant horizons
sound/commentary/artpassgarage.wav=gautam babbar we generally design and prototype the basic gameplay in a level before we apply much art to it throughout the first several months of playtesting this garage map the geometry was nothing more than basic shapes and textures after wed finalized most of the gameplay elements we began to flesh out the visuals for the area for this level we left the office and took reference pictures of various garages from these shots we pulled out everything we liked and that we thought we could pull off well we combined these visual highlights into what we call a styleguide map which is a standalone map with no gameplay that we use strictly as a visual reference for this level we actually made two styleguides one a destroyed garage the other intact after the look was established we brought the playable maps visual quality up to the level of the styleguides often a maps geometry needs to be changed as the art goes in because areas that worked in the abstract version no longer make sense in a map that now looks like a real place for instance the side rooms where two of the cars are hidden were moved several times in order to make them feel more naturally part of a parking garage
sound/commentary/benefitsofdarkness.wav=john guthrie the darkness in this area has a few real gameplay benefits it slows the player down which most of the time keeps alyx at your side the claustrophobia the close in combat and alyxs constant presence and reliance on your flashlight help enhance the tension and your sense of camaraderie in the dark the limited flashlight battery adds an extra layer of resource management to the tactics of combat
sound/commentary/hurryback.wav=bill fletcher creating a believable interesting relationship between gordon and alyx is made a lot tougher by the fact that gordon never talks this elevator scene presented a nice little opportunity to have alyx express some emotion in a situation where gordon isnt really in a position to respond
sound/commentary/doorblasts.wav=charlie burgin the first prototype of episode ones doorblast effect was here in the combine garrison being peppered with chunks of wood while soldiers poured into the room through a haze of smoke proved to be an effective dramatic tool it was also an excellent way to simultaneously ungate the player and flood the area with enemies it was so unanimously successful in playtests that we ended up adding it in several places throughout the episode
sound/commentary/stalkeriteration.wav=bill fletcher alyxs reactions to the stalkers went through a number of iterations in very early versions alyx was frightened by the stalkers that didnt work because it didnt fit with alyxs earlier reactions to stalkers in the citadel we changed it so that she expressed anger at the stalkers predicament early versions of this new direction failed because alyxs transition from generally upbeat to blind rage was simply too abrupt ultimately through rewrites and rigorous testing we found the right tone for the scene a simmering anger level that was more in tune with the situation
sound/commentary/holdupasec.wav=bill fletcher this is another multipurpose scene first alyx is visibly shaken which once again humanizes her but she also states the players goal for the second half of the game climb to the surface and get to the train station
sound/commentary/newtrainstation.wav=randy lundeen we needed a train station but we didnt want something that was too similar to the one in half life we decided to give this station a more industrial look to make it a place where trains were repaired and freight was offloaded we included some combine elements to help explain why the strider cant fire through the various strategic barricades required by the game design
sound/commentary/zombietrap.wav=john guthrie this space was designed to lure players onto a section of breakable floor that drops them into a room full of zombies players are enticed into the trap by some reward items and a chance to peek into a hole we like to surprise players but we never want them to feel that theyve been treated unfairly
sound/commentary/coredoors.wav=john morello late in development we changed the art for these doors so that players understood that they were entering the core area it turned out that having alyx talk about the area wasnt enough to give playtesters the sense that theyd finally arrived at the core
sound/commentary/intro.wav=gabe newell welcome to half life episode one we received a great deal of positive feedback on the commentary track in the lost coast and so weve included the same feature in this episode to listen to a commentary node put your crosshair over the floating commentary symbol and press your use key to stop a commentary node put your crosshair over the rotating node and press the use key again some commentary nodes may take control of the game in order to show something to you in these cases simply press your use key again to stop the commentary with episodic content we are hoping to release games much more frequently than has been possible with the monolithic development schedules of the past game developers and game customers have been wanting to try this for years please let me know what you think after you have had a chance to play this our latest installment in the ongoing adventures of gordon freeman i can be reached at gabenvalvesoftware com thanks and have fun
sound/commentary/airventcollapse.wav=john guthrie after the antlion guard fight playtesters were reporting some combat fatigue we decided to include an environmental puzzle here to break up the pacing before the subsequent street battle we originally worried that a densely packed room full of hopper mines tripmines and explosive barrels was a little too implausible but playtesters loved the sudden reveal of the room and then enjoyed navigating it so this ended up being another case where we accepted a tradeoff between fun and maintaining a strictly consistent fiction
sound/commentary/whereisshe.wav=doug wood monitor scenes such as this video transmission from dr mossman arent simply prerendered video these scenes actually unfold live in an inaccessible section of the map while being projected onto the monitor screen heres dr mossman in the small arctic base set its not nearly as far away from the citadels core control room as it appears to be in the level
sound/commentary/tempcover.wav=chet faliszek we wanted to keep the tension high in this fight but we also realized that players would need some cover these destructible panels satisfied both of those design goals effectively theyre timed shelters players can hide behind the panels but the strider will target them until theyre destroyed this gives players brief periods of safety during which they can plan their next move
sound/commentary/turrets.wav=gautam babbar this turret scenario was designed to showcase alyxs ability to provide cover for players in combat she always hangs back a little blasting anything that moves in the original version players could knock over the lightly protected turrets with a single rocket fired from the safe end of the corridor we thought itd be a nice way for players to feel like theyd pulled one over on the combine unfortunately playtesters routinely thought that theyd discovered a bug or at best an exploit that had arisen from sloppy design so in this case a situation wed deliberately created to make players feel clever actually caused them to think we werent doing our job very well as a result of this feedback we added a force field and additional grating to better protect the turrets
sound/commentary/strollwithbarney.wav=wade schin originally barney started off in this map in the doorway down by the citizens but playtesters tended to wander around for a while before stumbling across him we moved him up here to guarantee that his scene with alyx would unfold before players began any exploration hes standing over a dead metrocop because its a plausiblelooking long term activity in case players dont move directly down to him nearby reward items also tend to draw players toward him
sound/commentary/dog_dropship.wav=bill van buren sometimes we need to keep the player in an area so that we can deliver some critical dialog or run an important sequence of events in these cases we temporarily block the players path using what we call a gate these gates generally take the form of some obstacle that can only be removed or opened by some character or event in this case the obstacle is a crashed gunship that can only be moved out of the way by dog though the final scene looks pretty straightforward a lot of care had to be taken to make sure that dog hit his marks and played his sequences without trampling and damaging the player
sound/commentary/corepaths.wav=greg coomer the core was a central element of this part of the game and as much as possible we wanted to constantly reinforce its importance zigzagging through the space in three dimensions while navigating a variety of challenges let us present a few different visual and gameplay perspectives on the same space by letting the player see the core from a bunch of different angles we were able to give them a real sense of its scale
sound/commentary/spacerefinement.wav=charlie burgin in early versions of this area there was no side passage off the street and the gash in the road was created by the gunship that the player later fights in the hospital attic as development progressed however gameplay story and performance requirements made this initial design unworkable the new side passage provided a short break in the combat tension after the boss battle and also helped us to stay within our performance budget
sound/commentary/gunshipcloseup.wav=gautam babbar instead of letting the gunship ai have its own way here we forced the ship to crash right into the attic its a dramatic payoff for winning the battle and it gives players an opportunity to examine a gunship up close at their leisure
sound/commentary/citadellook.wav=randy lundeen we created a new citadel destruction set of broken combine panels and prefabs for the interior spaces to help make the citadel look like it was on the verge of exploding we also introduced a strong ambient orange color to help sell the fact that the citadel was in a much different state from the last time the player passed through the orange atmosphere was justified due to all the fires and smoke inside the citadel
sound/commentary/finalereqs.wav=lars jensvold apart from being a big visual payoff to the episode there were several story requirements that this ending sequence needed to convey it had to make it very clear that the citadel was destroyed that the citadel pods had escaped and it needed to imply that a data transmission beam was streaming out of the ruins we discovered that alyx had to be mostly silent during this scene or else players tended to look at her instead of all of the chaos around them
sound/commentary/garrisonapproach.wav=tom leonard our ai is inherently unscripted which means that we have to design spaces that permit our characters to make good choices the ai is better able to make intelligent decisions when there are alternate routes through a combat space this hallway started out as a straightshot corridor with a door at the end for soldiers to enter through but this design didnt provide the ai with enough choices to make the soldier behavior very interesting adding an additional space on the side allowed them to find cover and flank the player both of which dramatically improved the entertainment value of this encounter
sound/commentary/monitor_scene.wav=marc laidlaw right off the bat we needed to hammer home some story points reintroduce the cast of characters and explain the players immediate goal it was a pretty intimidating chunk of noninteractive exposition we generally approach these scenes by writing way too much and then through constant playtesting trimming the scene to more manageable levels in this case even after some heroic pruning the opening scene still felt too long we ended up splitting the introductory sequence into three scenes separated by some gravity gun puzzle solving and then a dramatic walk across a crumbling ledge
sound/commentary/tripminetraps.wav=ido magal tripmine traps are great but they were sort of hard to justify given the total chaos of city even though we couldnt use tripmines a lot they made sense in this interrupted ambush scene
sound/commentary/alg_vs_apc.wav=scott dalton at this point in the action we really felt that we needed a combat crescendo antlion guards make great boss challenges and we decided to add some combine forces to the mix because watching ai characters fight each other is always entertaining this setup had a few other benefits as well since players had previously only fought alone against the guards this was the first time theyd actually witness second hand the effects of a guard headbutt theyd also see an apc in action and in case there was any doubt get definite proof that combine soldiers and antlion guards dont get along underscoring the collapse of combine dominance in city
sound/commentary/noammo.wav=ido magal originally the player didnt get any weapons until the end of this map so rollermines were the only way to kill the soldiers as we added more content to previous levels it became impractical for players to be without a gun for so long as a result players get weapons much earlier now
sound/commentary/sealingoffcafe.wav=ido magal this explosion permanently seals the cafe door which has a few benefits from a design perspective weve found that when we limit the amount of backtracking players can do it gives them confidence to venture forward from a practical standpoint we can clean up the now unreachable entities giving us a big reduction in overhead it also helps to minimize potential bugs and exploits
sound/commentary/falling_debris.wav=matt t wood since we never take control away from the player it can be a real pain to get them to notice important environmental events its a constant design challenge for us the citadel will be erupting in a massive light show that took ten of us two months to orchestrate and if were not careful the player will end up facing the other direction staring at a tire in this case to establish that the citadel is coming apart at the seams we wanted the player to notice the debris falling off of it we used a pretty straightforward method here alyx explicitly mentions the citadel while pointing at it like most of these solutions its not foolproof but it has a high success rate
sound/commentary/alyxcitadeltone.wav=bill van buren we wanted to create an atmosphere of urgency in the citadel with alyx and the player focused on getting to the core to stop the impending collapse initially we tried to reflect that urgency through alyxs behavior and acting this proved to be unsustainable however if the player didnt choose to advance alyx eventually ran out of lines or animations and was forced into her very nonurgent idle states we found that the best approach was for alyx to have such implicit trust in and sympathy with the player that she is always content to proceed at whatever pace the player chooses once we adopted this principle lines where alyx sounded impatient or frustrated with the pace of progress quickly stood out and were cut
sound/commentary/barneysbigcrowbar.wav=jake nicholson barneys big crowbar scene required a few tricks to pull off there are actually three separate crowbar models in the sequence first theres one stuck in the machine when barney grabs that one we remove it from the world and switch on a crowbar thats been in barneys hand the entire time only invisible both of these models are purely decorative so as soon as barney makes his tossing motion we hide his crowbar again and create a third useable crowbar that then bounces to the ground
sound/commentary/zombinegrenades.wav=adrian finol were really happy with the zombines grenade behavior it adds sudden danger spikes to the zombie horde which force players to quickly reprioritize their targets and since the player can grab a grenade out of the zombines hand with the gravity gun these danger spikes can be converted into offensive opportunities this kind of turnaround skill shot creates some dynamic satisfying hero moments for the player originally we didnt allow the player to snatch zombine grenades because we felt it broke the fiction of the gravity gun if players could grab a zombines grenade why couldnt they grab the combine soldiers guns after playtesting the grenade steal though fun won out over consistency
sound/commentary/responserules.wav=jim dose for episode one we implemented a scripting component called the response rules system for dynamically managing npc speech we wanted to take npc speech out of the hands of the programmers and let the writers control it the writers were able to set up a wide range of situationally triggered character responses for instance alyx has different reactions to different enemies can warn the player of danger calls for help when shes mobbed and will ask for light the combat responses worked out great but its especially satisfying when alyxs comments on some situation mirror your own thoughts the writers really went crazy with this so be on the lookout for lots of little easter egg responses to unusual situations
sound/commentary/youremynewhero.wav=doug wood along with vistas positive feedback from alyx is one of our primary means of rewarding players in this case alyxs excitement over the striders destruction adds a sense of closure to the battle and gives players the satisfaction that someone witnessed and appreciated their heroics
sound/commentary/oldschool.wav=marc laidlaw barney like dr kleiner is one of the characters with the deepest roots in half life his personality is more iconic and retains more of the comic stylization of the first game this type of character allows us to mix up the mood a little bit to inject some absurd humor into the otherwise grim scenarios of the half life universe while characters such as alyx and eli vance have allowed us to explore more realistic dramatic possibilities we are still very much attached to our roots in satire and black humor
sound/commentary/podrising.wav=ted backman we revealed the pod here to let players see it up close at the same time we didnt want the player to get too good a look at whats inside an old version of this scene had the pod simply hanging from the ceiling it would burst open and then charge up your gravity gun but not do much else the current scene gives us a much more dramatic reveal of the pod and an opportunity to introduce the mind blast its capable of emitting though they dont play a large role in episode one these guys were a functional requirement of episode two which meant we effectively had to ship a piece of that episode early
sound/commentary/skilllevelchange.wav=steve bond the difference between skill levels isnt just a matter of damage dealt and received for instance in easy mode we increase the length of time a combine ball survives before exploding putting less pressure on the player to get the ball into a socket
sound/commentary/secondballtube.wav=scott dalton the second ball tube presents a variation of the pattern the player learned in the first ball tube while the first tube can be crossed slowly by crouching and maneuvering your way up the second ratchets up the pace requiring a quicker more responsive approach
sound/commentary/alyxnag.wav=matt t wood to convey a sense of urgency we originally designed alyx to nag the player pretty frequently shed say things like hurry up and keep moving whether or not this created a sense of urgency is debatable but after about three minutes of this the one thing it definitely did was make the player hate alyx this was one of the observations that eventually led us to switch alyx from generally leading players to almost always following through playtesting we discovered that players much preferred to set the pace themselves and that they especially disliked virtually any hint of bossiness from alyx
sound/commentary/flashlightgameplay.wav=steve bond initially the player wasnt going to have a weapon here the combination of no weapon and near total darkness forced the player to use the flashlight to direct alyxs fire we liked the idea that you could interact with alyx in a meaningful way using elements that were already built into the interface unfortunately playtesters didnt like not having a weapon so we added weapons back in luckily it turned out that even armed players tended to still use and enjoy the flashlight mechanic
sound/commentary/thecore.wav=dhabih eng the core design posed a lot of difficult challenges generally speaking if the gameplay in a particular map isnt working we can simply cut the entire area that wasnt true of the core because we knew it was critical to the story on top of that designing citadel gameplay is often a bigger challenge than working out areas in city largely because citadel levels have a narrower set of gameplay tools there are less enemy types available and the player is usually only armed with the gravity gun because of this we had to go through many iterations of the core design one of the early prototypes was a kind of futuristic version of operation where players had to use the gravity gun to cleanly manipulate rods into slots in the core that didnt work partly because playtesters found that their view was obstructed by the rods which made it frustratingly difficult to manipulate them with any kind of precision we prototyped playtested and abandoned several other designs until we finally arrived at one that was fun while still being challenging enough to give players the sense that theyd accomplished a significant goal
sound/commentary/whatwasthatthing.wav=keith huggins its important that the player has some empathy for alyx rather than just seeing her as a bulletspitting robot the brief recovery scene after the pod mind attack reminds the player that alyx is affected by events in the world
sound/commentary/puzzlearc.wav=john guthrie this is where some player training pays off after earlier training players on the use of ballsockets they get a sort of live fire test here starting the elevator this is the beginning of this levels puzzle arc where a basic gameplay mechanic is made increasingly more complex by layering other puzzle elements on it this first puzzle only requires that the player find a combine ball and put it in the socket
sound/commentary/balltubes.wav=scott dalton the ball tubes are an example of us working within our available toolkit to create a puzzle around a recognized concept as a physical navigation puzzle its different from what the player has experienced before and its challenging while not being a binary succeed or fail situation there are a number of ways to approach this puzzle in addition to simply dodging jumping and ducking the balls the player can grab or deflect them with his gravity gun or pick up the hatch and use it as a shield to block the incoming barrage
sound/commentary/crouchingalyx.wav=robin walker character ai is all about putting on a good show as we neared the end of production we were still unhappy with the way that alyx handled herself in combat the most common thing she did was to run backwards while shooting at enemies it was realistic but boring we added crouching and aiming at the last minute and though it didnt change her combat effectiveness in any functional way it made her a whole lot more fun to watch this is a great example of how relatively minor presentation and behavior changes can have a major impact on entertainment value
sound/commentary/nodegraph.wav=robin walker what youre seeing here is a visual representation of a nodegraph a set of nodes and the connections between them nodegraphs tell our np cs how they can move around the world its not a specific set of instructions but rather a sort of information repository among other things np cs use the nodegraph to dynamically chart paths to distant areas find cover and scout out firing positions with a clear line of sight to their enemy
sound/commentary/puzzlerefinement.wav=scott dalton having trained the player that balls fit into sockets we wanted to introduce a puzzle where the question was how to get the ball into the socket the puzzle we came up with involved a socket with an object blocking it so that the player would have to ricochet the ball into place that sounded simple until we actually tried to implement it if we made the covering opaque playtesters didnt realize that there was a socket behind it when we made it translucent they often didnt see it was there and were confused when their shot bounced off making it movable was a red herring making people think they could knock it away a couple of subtle art changes helped we added some more prominent shadowing and made the glass panel flash whenever it was hit with a ball some playtesters consistently searched for a position to get a direct shot which we didnt discourage as an alternate solution
sound/commentary/dog_throw.wav=bill van buren our games are created by design collectives that we call cabals when the idea to have you and alyx sit in a van and then have dog toss it across the gorge was first suggested during a cabal meeting everyone thought it was funny and then we moved on to more serious solutions for the gorge crossing as the design progressed though we kept coming back to the van idea and eventually everyone agreed that we should give it a try even though the idea was kind of outrageous it satisfied some key goals we had for the scene alyx and the player get across the impassable gorge and dog is able to play a key role in the mission while also plausibly getting left behind there were still some problems to solve though attaching animated models to the van was tricky making sure the van didnt kill the player took some thought and it took a number of tries before we were able to really illuminate dogs thinking as he went from testing his idea with chunks of debris to finally presenting the plan to alyx ultimately we were able to create a scene that solved some tricky game design issues provided an intimate view of the relationship between alyx and dog and delivered a surprising and visceral entrance to the citadel
sound/commentary/escortmap.wav=ido magal here we wanted to include something a little different an escort mission most of our gameplay involves constant forward motion so we wanted to design a situation where players would fight through the same basic area multiple times this temporary backtracking would create a series of encounters where players had a full tactical awareness of their surroundings once again all of this turned out to be more easily said than done and this sequence went through a lot of iterations originally the train yard was one big space this approach had a couple of problems since players had a constant unbroken view of the entire area it was virtually impossible to maneuver enemies into position for staged combat events and because they could always see the goal players didnt get much of a sense that they were leading citizens somewhere the citizens couldnt get to on their own ultimately we broke the environment into two different spaces a parking lot and a maintenance building because neither area can be seen from the other were able to repopulate the spaces with new more deadly combinations of enemies while the player isnt looking it also makes the journey feel lengthier and more significant
sound/commentary/advisorsighting.wav=matt scott we wanted players to realize that theyve been spotted and the combine are now aware of their arrival at the train station it sounds like a simple task but it actually took a lot of thought to draw the players attention to the various events that communicate this message first a train horn sounds which gives alyx an opportunity to mention that the station is in sight next the lights go off to grab the players attention and to make the monitors stand out in the dark at this point the player should be looking at one of the monitors so finally the kleiner transmission is interrupted briefly by a combine advisor originally the advisor appeared on a jumbotron outside but we were never able to reliably make playtesters look at it the flashing combine camera should also provide some indication that trouble is brewing though its not a proper gate the zombie draped over the exit is designed to slow the player down just long enough for alyx to finish her lines
sound/commentary/intro_design.wav=greg coomer this intro sequence establishes some important initial pieces of episode ones story and setting our earlier versions of the intro sequence were heavy on graphic effects and relatively light on storytelling when we showed those early versions to playtesters they thought it was cool but rarely had any idea what was supposed to be happening we went through several iterations each time simplifying the editing and tightening the effects we eventually arrived at a good middle ground between the sort of psychedelic look we were shooting for and basic comprehension of what was actually taking place
sound/commentary/stalkertrainmodels.wav=matt t wood in much the same way that movie effects often utilize different versions of the same model there are actually three trains that make up the stalker scene the first one is the moving train you see arrive at the platform the one youre in right now is a static interior with lights moving outside of it to give the illusion of motion the third train is the crashed version its a tilted banged up and totally separate area from the moving version the transition from moving to crashed is disguised by a brief fade to black
sound/commentary/citdestruction.wav=scott dalton impending destruction is a recurring theme in the citadel from story mood and visual standpoints this changes the citadel the destruction needed to feel natural rather than entirely scripted on the players actions not showing the destructive events dynamically makes the player assume the level of damage is static however if the events are too obviously triggered by player movement the destruction feels too scripted we found the solution was to give the player glimpses of things happening at the periphery of the player space as well as in their immediate vicinity to give the feeling that this stuff is happening whether the player is present or not
sound/commentary/alyx_specular.wav=jason mitchell alyx travels through much of episode one with the player and consequently passes through a wider variety of lighting conditions than she did in half life this meant that we had to improve the quality of the lighting algorithms used on alyx to look realistic in any situation from the eerie hallways of the citadel to the streets of city at sunset for this episode we added a specular lighting term to the shaders used on alyx which provides a realistic shiny look to her skin her leather jacket and even her teeth in these new lighting calculations we chose to specifically emphasize bright highlights caused by illumination from grazing angles this type of lighting also referred to as rim lighting is particularly dramatic when coming from lowangle light sources such as this bright sunset youll also note that the rim lighting is further enhanced by our highdynamic range postprocessing which causes the specular highlights to bloom in a striking and dramatic fashion we have found that the move to an episodic development cycle allows us to take advantage of the fast pace of graphics hardware innovation by incrementally adding new features such as alyxs new lighting techniques to the source engine with each new episode
sound/commentary/intro_effects.wav=gary mc taggart we used an upgrade of the refract shader from half life to make the vortigaunts warp into the intro the major difference is that this time we are refracting only pixels that come from the vortigaunts themselves we placed a large sheet of refractive geometry in front of each vortigaunt to achieve this effect
sound/commentary/collapsingelevator.wav=john guthrie at one point this was the site of a physically simulated elevator puzzle it was kind of neat but it caused a lot of problems in playtests even though the puzzle mostly obeyed the laws of physics it wasnt at all in line the with the way wed trained players to expect elevators to work in our world we considered adding some earlier training to support it but quickly abandoned the idea in favor of a redesign that was more immediately understandable while still being fun
sound/commentary/followthewire.wav=gautam babbar this area is the dramatic culmination of all the lightless combat that comes before it we wanted to create a dynamic fight that lasted several minutes while you waited for the elevator to arrive the first iteration of this battle was very different from what we eventually shipped the space was larger had water in it and wasnt completely dark water is relatively expensive performancewise so we cut that in favor of more zombies we made the level smaller to ensure that the player would see the elevator and recognize the problem that needed to be solved before the fight started we killed the lights both to enhance tension and to make this scene a final test of the darkfighting skills that the player develops over the course of the episode finally we added a wire running along the ceiling from the elevator to the powerbox to give players a guide as they familiarize themselves with the area
sound/commentary/padlockmistakes.wav=erik johnson this shipping container used to be accessible only after the player destroyed a padlock given the amount of stress during this part of the game even a simple puzzle in this case destroying a lock would be completely missed by the player in the end we felt like the arena we had built for the player to fight the strider was fun enough without this added element so we removed it
sound/commentary/bangingzombies.wav=gautam babbar the doorbanging zombies were supposed to give players a safe glimpse of a threat theyd have to face later in the level in the original design players couldnt open the door the zombies would burst through on their own after the player had done a little exploring we abandoned that plan when many playtesters exhibited a pretty much singleminded fascination with opening the door as soon as they saw it we made the door openable though if players ignore it the zombies will eventually break it down themselves
sound/commentary/poisonambush.wav=john guthrie poison headcrabs are ideal for ambushes because they startle you but cant actually kill you here after a series of right hand turns you round a corner into a dead end while youre cracking open a box of goodies youre ambushed by a poison headcrab constructing the ambush this way increased the odds that you wouldnt see the crab but would hear it just in time to turn around as it leapt at your head
sound/commentary/rolleradventure.wav=steve bond in a good puzzle the player is presented with an overall goal and then faces a number of smaller challenges in pursuit of that goal in the case of the stalker puzzle we start with how do i open the door from there we move to how do i get to the stalker then to how do i get to the rollermines how do i get the rollermine back to alyx and finally how do i use the rollermine to disable the stalker
sound/commentary/corecolorscheme.wav=randy lundeen the higher contrast white combine motif of the core sets it apart from the rest of the citadel and heightens its importance within the visual style of combine aesthetics it also helps enhance the sense of heat and radiation in the space
sound/commentary/podroomlook.wav=randy lundeen we decided this space needed to look unique and appear to have more significance than the rest of the citadel areas the player had already traveled through while at the same time feeling as though it was still made with combine technology this room introduces a story point that plays a big role in episode two so the player has to feel like something important is going on in here a different fog setting as well as different light styles and configurations helped achieve this the red lighting is a good contrast to the traditional bluegreen colors of the citadel
sound/commentary/alyxsniper.wav=steve kalning one of the primary design goals of episode one was to convey the sense that alyx and the player are a team this sniper sequence provides an opportunity for alyx to offer combat support in a cool new way it also gives the player a chance to watch zombies get sniped up close and from various angles
sound/commentary/youdidthemath.wav=yahn bernier its really important to us to create scenes that showcase strong relationships between our characters the relationship between alyx and dog seems to be especially satisfying to players in the scene leading up to the van toss we had a bug before the animation was complete where dogs head would shake as he looked back at alyx in a happy accident his head shook right after she asked him you did do the math right in playtests players thought this was intentional and always laughed because of that we worked it into the animation and it ended up being a terrific little moment between dog and alyx
sound/commentary/ohmygod.wav=doug wood this is another key vista this time showing the core its a visual payoff for the players success in getting here and simultaneously a way to present the player with a view of the next challenge
sound/commentary/crumbtrail.wav=jeff hameluck we often use goodies such as this crate and the scanner battery around the corner to guide players along a preset route we want players to hit their marks during a battle without drawing attention to the fact that theyre being subtly manipulated down a particular path
sound/commentary/alg_strategy.wav=steve bond antlion guard arenas have a few specific design requirements for instance since the guard is only armed with a melee attack we cant let the player reach any place thats inaccessible to the guard such as rooftops and other high perches that the player could only arrive at after being launched by a guard headbutt the arenas also need plenty of physics objects for the guard to toss and at least one unlimited ammo crate so that the player cant run out of ammunition before killing the guard for this battle we also introduced a steady stream of regular antlions to limit the players ability to constantly circle the antlion guard
sound/commentary/shotgunalyx.wav=robin walker we designed this area to be an entertaining showcase for npc combat because of our dynamic ai these kinds of battles never play out the same way twice players often like to sit back watch the show and then dive into the fray at their own discretion we also felt it was time to introduce a new combat ability for alyx so we gave her a shotgun here not only are shotguns terrific for zombie hunting their size and ponderous handling characteristics make for some great combat animations
sound/commentary/coresphere.wav=gary mc taggart the core sphere was one of the last special effects that we finished to achieve its effect the core uses animated textures flowmaps normalmapped refraction and specularity as well as volumetric particulate matter rendering which takes advantage of the core being a sphere
sound/commentary/dynamicss.wav=robin walker you fight alongside alyx for much of episode one so her combat really needed to look varied and exciting we especially wanted to get her into some convincing physical contact with her enemies wed always wanted to do this kind of dynamic character interaction but getting the np cs into position for their interactions has a wideranging set of problems we ended up taking an opportunistic approach for episode one instead of figuring out how to maneuver characters into proximity the system monitors their positions and fires the appropriate animations whenever it notices that theyre correctly aligned given how well these interactions worked out between alyx and zombies headcrabs and antlions were looking forward to extending this kind of behavior to all of our np cs
sound/commentary/hospitalrespite.wav=gautam babbar too much of the same type of uninterrupted gameplay causes fatigue through repeated playtests we learned that by the time players reached this part of the hospital they were ready for a break from intense combat in response to that feedback we inserted this relatively calm exploration puzzle as a change of pace it gives players a respite from combat while still presenting them with an interesting challenge
sound/commentary/newstrider.wav=steve bond for this climactic battle we created a new ai that makes the strider a more interesting opponent it has a snappier cannon attack can better track the players movements and it now has the ability to target the environment in dangerous ways for instance its cannon fire can shove heavy shipping containers straight into the player
sound/commentary/rollertraining.wav=matt t wood training is one of the fundamental tenets of our design philosophy before the player is required to utilize some new game mechanic or new weapon or face a new monster under pressure in a dangerous situation we always introduce the concept in a relatively calm but ideally still entertaining way this entire scene teaches the player that alyx can convert rollermines so that they can be used as a friendly weapon later the player is required to do this in more pressing circumstances but at this point everythings still pretty calm in the original design the player retrieved a rollermine from a dispenser and used it to take out a combine soldier who was holding the field from the other side eventually we scrapped that idea and combined the rollermine training with some stalker exposition that originally occurred in a separate scene
sound/commentary/alyx_ledge.wav=robin walker this ledge is a really tricky spot for np cs to navigate while we wanted alyx to be able to maneuver dynamically through any complex environment in certain navigation situations were faced with a trade off between flexibility and visual quality in this particular case she navigates this ledge with a combination of ai and scripted animations we continue to evolve the systems of half life whereby characters move fluidly through dynamic ai and scripted navigation but ultimately what matters most is how it looks to the player
sound/commentary/firstvista.wav=charlie brown we populate our environments with spots where players can take a break to look out over an expanse of cool scenery we call these vistas this particular vista was designed to give anyone familiar with the citadel interior from half life a good view of what it looks like now that everythings falling apart the pods that are sliding off their track and into the abyss really sell the idea that the citadel is halfabandoned and in chaos
sound/commentary/powerboxes.wav=jake nicholson originally the player couldnt operate the power boxes and would have to wait for alyx to do it we thought itd be entertaining to watch alyx do some cool thing while you protected her unfortunately that didnt work out playtesters were more annoyed than entertained the other problem was that having alyx committed to a particular activity while action was still going on in the world tended to quickly expose her most robotic tendencies shed either ignore what was going on or completely stop whatever activity the player was waiting for her to finish either way it was unconvincing and frustrating we learned that whenever alyx commits to some action in a dynamic environment she needs to finish it quickly and move on
sound/commentary/3stepapproach.wav=scott dalton the light bridge ball sockets are a clear example of our training approach to new gameplay elements we train players with a leading example confirm they understand the concept then switch up the problem set and make them use it in a new way the first bridge shows players the solution the second one confirms they understand the third knowing they understand the gameplay mechanic challenges them in a new way using that mechanism
