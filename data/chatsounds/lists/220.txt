sound/vo/citadel/br_nothingtosay_b.wav=ill send them on their way and then we can talk openly
sound/vo/breencast/br_instinct22.wav=they have given us the strength we never could have summoned to overcome this compulsion
sound/vo/breencast/br_collaboration10.wav=therefore i say yes i am a collaborator we must all collaborate willingly eagerly if we expect to reap the benefits of unification
sound/vo/citadel/br_mentors.wav=your mentors are partly to blame of course my disappointment in eli vance and isaac kleiner is far greater than my sorrow over your unfortunate choice of career path in a way i suppose you could not have done otherwise who knows what seeds of iconoclasm they planted when you were young and gullible but while they certainly share a great part of the responsibility for the recent troubles it is you alone who have chosen to act with such willful disregard for humanitys future
sound/vo/citadel/br_oheli09.wav=intersect impossible to describe with our limited vocabulary
sound/vo/breencast/br_instinct09.wav=instinct was our mother when we were an infant species
sound/vo/citadel/br_mock07.wav=i could have told you that was pointless dr freeman
sound/vo/breencast/br_instinct05.wav=first let us consider the fact that for the first time ever as a species immortality is in our reach
sound/vo/citadel/br_rabble_a.wav=thanks to you we have everything we need in that regard
sound/vo/breencast/br_overwatch02.wav=let me say up front that i regret having to temper my heartfelt congratulations with a strong measure of disappointment but i wouldnt be doing my duty as your administrator if i didnt pass along the message i have received from our benefactors
sound/vo/breencast/br_tofreeman06.wav=you have plunged humanity into freefall
sound/vo/breencast/br_disruptor03.wav=and yet unsophisticated minds continue to imbue him with romantic power giving him such dangerous poetic labels as the one free man the opener of the way
sound/vo/breencast/br_instinct25.wav=and that day of transformation i have it on good authority is close at hand
sound/vo/breencast/br_collaboration06.wav=would we model ourselves on the trilobite
sound/vo/citadel/br_playgame_b.wav=if you wont do the right thing for the good of all people
sound/vo/citadel/br_circum.wav=well dr freeman under other circumstances i like to think we might have been able to work together in an atmosphere of mutual trust and respect certainly judging from your brief tenure at black mesa while i was its administrator you showed every promise of becoming a valuable and productive contributor to the scientific process and yet im not sure what spurred you to it but there is really no place in this enterprise for a rogue physicist
sound/vo/breencast/br_collaboration11.wav=and reap we shall
sound/vo/citadel/br_rabble_c.wav=what neither you nor i can do is convince that rabble in the streets to give up their senseless struggle
sound/vo/breencast/br_instinct14.wav=instinct would inflict a fatal injury on our species
sound/vo/breencast/br_instinct08.wav=i find it helpful at times like these to remind myself that our true enemy is instinct
sound/vo/citadel/br_ohshit.wav=oh shit
sound/vo/citadel/br_goback.wav=go back freeman you have no idea what youre doing
sound/vo/citadel/br_youfool.wav=you fool
sound/vo/breencast/br_instinct03.wav=i also detect some unspoken questions do our benefactors really know whats best for us what gives them the right to make this kind of decision for mankind will they ever deactivate the suppression field and let us breed again
sound/vo/citadel/br_synapse02.wav=when the singularity collapses i will be far away from here in another universe as a matter of fact you on the other hand will be destroyed in every way it is possible to be destroyedand even in some which are essentially impossible
sound/vo/breencast/br_overwatch01.wav=i have been asked to say a few words to the transhuman arm of sector seventeen overwatch concerning recent successes in containing members of the resistance science team
sound/vo/citadel/br_newleader_c.wav=and this one has proven to be a fine pawn for those who control him
sound/vo/breencast/br_disruptor06.wav=if you see this socalled free man report him
sound/vo/novaprospekt/br_disturb.wav=from your area
sound/vo/citadel/br_newleader_b.wav=fortunately the resistance has shown it is willing to accept a new leader
sound/vo/breencast/br_overwatch05.wav=however we cannot count on such developments doctor freemans reputation is such that other desperate renegades are likely to grant him a great deal of license in the spirit of spreading general chaos and terror
sound/vo/citadel/br_rabble_b.wav=youre more than qualified to finish his research yourself
sound/vo/breencast/br_overwatch07.wav=how could one man have slipped through your forces fingers time and time again how is it possible this is not some agent provocateur or highly trained assassin we are discussing gordon freeman is a theoretical physicist who had hardly earned the distinction of his ph d at the time of the black mesa incident i have good reason to believe that in the intervening years he was in a state that precluded further development of covert skills the man you have consistently failed to slow let alone capture is by all standards simply thatan ordinary man how can you have failed to apprehend him
sound/vo/citadel/br_stubborn.wav=alyx my dear you have your mothers eyes but your fathers stubborn nature
sound/vo/citadel/br_mock06.wav=i warned you this was futile
sound/vo/breencast/br_disruptor07.wav=civic deeds do not go unrewarded and contrariwise complicity with his cause will not go unpunished
sound/vo/citadel/br_rabble_d.wav=yet eli refuses to speak the words that would save them all
sound/vo/breencast/br_instinct11.wav=and started at the shadows that leapt upon the caverns walls
sound/vo/breencast/br_instinct18.wav=instinct therefore must be expunged
sound/vo/citadel/br_yesjudith.wav=yes judith what is it
sound/vo/citadel/br_foundation.wav=i have laid the foundation for humanitys survival and not as we have narrowly defined ourselves but as something greater than we could ever imagine something we can only now begin to glimpse
sound/vo/citadel/br_no.wav=no
sound/vo/breencast/br_collaboration09.wav=and only the universal union that small minds call the combine can carry us there
sound/vo/citadel/br_playgame_a.wav=eli
sound/vo/citadel/br_betrayed.wav=they know you betrayed them theyll turn on you judith dr mossman please
sound/vo/breencast/br_welcome07.wav=its safer here
sound/vo/breencast/br_welcome02.wav=you have chosen or been chosen to relocate to one of our finest remaining urban centers
sound/vo/citadel/br_unleash.wav=you dont know what youll unleash you could bring down this whole citadel think man think of the people below
sound/vo/breencast/br_instinct10.wav=instinct coddled us and kept us safe in those hardscrabble years when we hardened our sticks and cooked our first meals above a meager fire
sound/vo/breencast/br_welcome05.wav=i have been proud to call city my home and so whether you are here to stay or passing through on your way to parts unknown
sound/vo/citadel/br_youneedme.wav=you need me
sound/vo/novaprospekt/br_overzealous.wav=the soldiers were a bit overzealous i admit but he was too tempting a prize to simply turn loose especially in the absence of gordon freeman
sound/vo/breencast/br_instinct24.wav=let me assure you that the suppressing field will be shut off on the day that we have mastered ourselves the day we can prove we no longer need it
sound/vo/citadel/br_judithwhat.wav=judith what do you think youre doing
sound/vo/novaprospekt/br_leeway01.wav=this is not open to debate dr mossman
sound/vo/k_lab/br_thereheis.wav=gordon freeman
sound/vo/breencast/br_instinct01.wav=let me read a letter i recently received dear dr breen why has the combine seen fit to suppress our reproductive cycle sincerely a concerned citizen
sound/vo/breencast/br_tofreeman02.wav=yes im talking to you
sound/vo/breencast/br_instinct20.wav=we should thank our benefactors for giving us respite from this overpowering force
sound/vo/breencast/br_tofreeman03.wav=the socalled one free man i have a question for you how could you have thrown it all away it staggers the mind
sound/vo/breencast/br_disruptor02.wav=his figure is synonymous with the darkest urges of instinct ignorance and decay some of the worst excesses of the black mesa incident have been laid directly at his feet
sound/vo/breencast/br_tofreeman04.wav=a man of science with the ability to sway reactionary and fearful minds toward the truth
sound/vo/breencast/br_overwatch06.wav=this brings me to the one note of disappointment i must echo from our benefactors obviously i am not on the ground to closely command or secondguess the dedicated forces of the overwatch but this does not mean i can shirk responsibility for recent lapses and even outright failures on their part i have been severely questioned about these shortcomings and now must put the question to you
sound/vo/citadel/br_bidder_b.wav=did you realize your contract was open to the highest bidder
sound/vo/citadel/br_oheli07.wav=carbon stars with ancient satellites colonized by sentient fungi
sound/vo/k_lab/br_tele_05.wav=how did you get in here
sound/vo/breencast/br_tofreeman07.wav=even if you offered your surrender now i cannot guarantee that our benefactors would accept it
sound/vo/breencast/br_instinct19.wav=it must be fought tooth and nail beginning with the basest of human urges the urge to reproduce
sound/vo/citadel/br_guest_d.wav=and then you deliver yourself
sound/vo/citadel/br_laugh01.wav=laughter
sound/vo/breencast/br_collaboration05.wav=it crept forth boldly while its brethren remained in the blackest ocean abyss with lidless eyes forever staring at the dark ignorant and doomed despite their eternal vigilance
sound/vo/breencast/br_instinct02.wav=thank you for writing concerned of course your question touches on one of the basic biological impulses with all its associated hopes and fears for the future of the species
sound/vo/citadel/br_freemanatlast.wav=so this is dr freeman at last i wish i could say this was a pleasant surprise but its neither a surprise nor as you would surely agree very pleasant well i am nothing if not pragmatic
sound/vo/citadel/br_synapse.wav=dr freeman you really shouldnt be out there at the moment of synapse as i teleport this chamber will be bathed in deadly particles that have yet to be named by human science perhaps when i have the leisure to do the work myself ill name one after you that way you wont be completely forgotten
sound/vo/citadel/br_gift_a.wav=thats all up to you my old friend
sound/vo/citadel/br_guards.wav=guards get in here
sound/vo/citadel/br_guest_c.wav=first you lead me straight to the doorstep of my oldest friend
sound/vo/citadel/br_mock05.wav=i dont know what you can possibly hope to achieve apart from your own annihilation
sound/vo/citadel/br_bidder_a.wav=how about it dr freeman
sound/vo/breencast/br_overwatch03.wav=the capture of eli vance is an event of major significance make no mistake and while its true that conceivably we could have taken him at almost any time in the last several years the manner of his capture may prove to have unexpected benefits
sound/vo/citadel/br_nopoint.wav=oh its hardly the worst but you might find that hard to believe once you get there
sound/vo/breencast/br_overwatch04.wav=it cannot have gone unnoticed by all resistance members that doctor vances capture coincided with the act of giving shelter to gordon freeman this might cause other resistance members to think twice before harboring doctor freeman it might cause them to question his allegiance even prompt some to turn him out or turn him over to our cause
sound/vo/breencast/br_instinct04.wav=allow me to address the anxieties underlying your concerns rather than try to answer every possible question you might have left unvoiced
sound/vo/breencast/br_tofreeman08.wav=at the moment i fear they have begun to look upon even me with suspicion so much for serving as humanitys representative
sound/vo/breencast/br_instinct12.wav=but inseparable from instinct is its dark twin superstition
sound/vo/breencast/br_instinct06.wav=this simple fact has farreaching implications it requires radical rethinking and revision of our genetic imperatives
sound/vo/citadel/br_mock01.wav=are you still with us dr freeman not for much longer i think
sound/vo/novaprospekt/br_blinded.wav=i have known dr vance far longer than you my dear im afraid your feelings for him may have blinded you
sound/vo/breencast/br_instinct23.wav=they have given us purpose they have turned our eyes toward the stars
sound/vo/breencast/br_collaboration01.wav=it has come to my attention that some have lately called me a collaborator as if such a term were shameful
sound/vo/citadel/br_dictate_a.wav=having both of you in my keeping ensures i can dictate the terms of any bargain i care to make with the combine
sound/vo/citadel/br_deliver.wav=its me you should be concerned about i can still deliver earth but not without your help
sound/vo/citadel/br_guest_a.wav=well if it isnt gordon freeman at last
sound/vo/citadel/br_mock09.wav=i hope you said your farewells
sound/vo/citadel/br_hostbody.wav=a host body you must be joking i cant possibly
sound/vo/novaprospekt/br_outoftime.wav=so sorry judith im all out of time
sound/vo/citadel/br_gift_b.wav=will you let your stubborn shortsightedness doom the entire species or
sound/vo/citadel/br_gift_c.wav=will you give your child the chance her mother never had
sound/vo/citadel/br_guest_f.wav=if id known you were going come straight up to my office i wouldnt have bothered hunting you in the first place
sound/vo/citadel/br_guest_b.wav=you have my gratitude doctor
sound/vo/citadel/br_playgame_c.wav=maybe youll do it for one of them
sound/vo/breencast/br_instinct15.wav=instinct creates its own oppressors and bids us rise up against them
sound/vo/breencast/br_instinct21.wav=they have thrown a switch and exorcised our demons in a single stroke
sound/vo/citadel/br_farside.wav=really well lets see how it serves you on the far side of a combine portal
sound/vo/breencast/br_disruptor05.wav=we have scarcely begun to climb from the dark pit of our species evolution let us not slide backward into oblivion just as we have finally begun to see the light
sound/vo/breencast/br_instinct16.wav=instinct tells us that the unknown is a threat rather than an opportunity
sound/vo/breencast/br_tofreeman10.wav=help ensure that humanitys trust in you is not misguided
sound/vo/citadel/br_newleader_a.wav=i agree its a total waste
sound/vo/breencast/br_collaboration07.wav=are all the accomplishments of humanity fated to be nothing more than a layer of broken plastic shards thinly strewn across a fossil bed sandwiched between the burgess shale and an eons worth of mud
sound/vo/breencast/br_instinct07.wav=it also requires planning and forethought that run in direct opposition to our neural presets
sound/vo/k_lab/br_tele_02.wav=whats the meaning of this
sound/vo/citadel/br_nothingtosay_a.wav=i understand if you dont wish to discuss this in front of your friends
sound/vo/citadel/br_create.wav=tell me dr freeman if you can you have destroyed so much what is it exactly that you have created can you name even one thing i thought not
