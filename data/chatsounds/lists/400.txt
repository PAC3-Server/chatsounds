sound/commentary/prtl-comment063.wav=nick maggiore this is the first map in which we experimented with solving the puzzle in as few portal placements as possible we tried to fit that concept into the story mode but were never quite able to sell it instead of abandoning the idea altogether we added the concept to a series of postgame challenge maps
sound/commentary/prtl-comment058.wav=jason brashill originally a weighted button was used to open the far door but playtesters so strongly associated boxes with buttons that theyd get stuck searching hopelessly for a box we changed the big button to a pedestal mounted push button thus removing the box association but playtesters still had trouble realizing they needed to shoot a portal through the door adding a ticking timer sound when the door was open cued players that the puzzle expected them to act during that time which solved the problem
sound/commentary/prtl-comment021.wav=kim swift its absolutely critical that players quickly wrap their heads around what a portal is we noticed early playtesters grasped the concept much more quickly when they caught a glimpse of themselves through a portal so we deliberately positioned this first portal to ensure that players will invariably see themselves
sound/commentary/prtl-comment032.wav=chet faliszek for training purposes theres generally just one correct solution to these early puzzles the original version of this room didnt have the glass barrier playtesters would often stand on the button to open the door and then shoot a blue portal through the opening bypassing the box entirely since this puzzle was meant illustrate the relationship between boxes and buttons that solution while clever was a failure so we added the glass barrier to prevent it later in the game however the puzzles become more openended
sound/commentary/prtl-comment107.wav=ellen mc lain voice of g lados so when they told me that there was going to be a song at the end i thought well allright whos going to write the song and they told me there was going to be a song written by jonathan coulton and i listened to a song that jonathan had written and it was very funny very clever so i thought at that point well you know thisll be okay but i am an opera singer so usually i sing opera singing and i thought well will i be able to have the right style for the song so i was concerned but then before the recording they sent me an mp file of the song and i listened to it with jonathan singing it but i loved the little song and at home as i practiced the little song i tried to you know get back to g ladoss voice you know aperture science just this tiny little passiveaggressive computer whos all alone until people try to come in and murder her so of course she gets upset but she seems she seems to have this real affinity for cake and and i want to play the game because i want to recreate the cake recipe and then put portal on it and be able to serve it to my friends when they come over to my house
sound/commentary/prtl-comment061.wav=david kircher this is a great spot to appreciate the recursive nature of portals if you place a portal on each side of this hallway youll notice the portals seem to go on forever similar to the effect you get in a hall of mirrors in actuality we support a maximum of nine recursive portal views down any chain of portals we achieve the impression of infinite recursion by copying part of the previously rendered frame onto the final portal in the recursive chain its not absolutely perfect but its inexpensive and effective
sound/commentary/prtl-comment044.wav=david kircher we previously talked about how we handle static portal collision but collision with moving objects on the other side of the portal is a completely different and equally hard problem walking onto this scaffold was a very iffy proposition for the first few months of development we solve the problem of colliding with these dynamic objects by cloning the objects from one portal to the other and strictly controlling what objects are allowed to collide with each other and how theyre allowed to collide
sound/commentary/prtl-comment096.wav=realm lovejoy after players escape we let them solve an old chamber in a new way this reintroduction of a familiar space which can now be solved in an incorrect way helps convey the sense that players are cheating the system while forging their own path through the facility
sound/commentary/prtl-comment015.wav=kim swift one of the things we learned from narbacular drop our student project that became portal was that beginning players often thought portals took them into other spaces or even other dimensions to help fight that notion we start players in a visually unique room with memorable objects so that when they walk through a portal for the first time they have a clear point of reference which communicates the idea that theyre still in the same basic location for instance the radio which is playing an instrumental version of still alive helps as well by providing some audio continuity
sound/commentary/prtl-comment071.wav=realm lovejoy in this puzzle we wanted players to realize that using portals they can travel long distances in a short step originally we had stairs from the ground level to the upper rooms many playtesters however were able to run from one room to the other quickly enough to consider it a solution without ever thinking to use the even easier portal method by changing the stairs to very slow moving lifts we were able to level the travel time for all player experience levels thus making the intended solution more clear
sound/commentary/prtl-comment040.wav=chris chin even though layering player training was a design goal from the start we still ended up introducing some concepts too quickly for instance this used to be the first energyball redirection puzzle playtesting revealed that this puzzle introduced too many new concepts at once which ended up frustrating a lot of playtesters in response we inserted two test chambers before this one to make the energyball redirection training more gradual
sound/commentary/prtl-comment009.wav=scott dalton as the end of the game draws closer we increase the ratio of timepressured puzzles like this turret ambush to give players the sense that theyre approaching a climactic encounter
sound/commentary/prtl-comment080.wav=realm lovejoy even though we didnt want portal to be too combat heavy we wanted to add at least a light combat mechanic after a few lessthansuccessful attempts to actually realize this light combat concept we settled on turrets as a good compromise the turrets can be defeated with tricky portal maneuvers but theyre also susceptible to a more straightforward berserker approach
sound/commentary/prtl-comment029.wav=nick maggiore early versions of portal featured more detailed cluttered environments much like half life we quickly realized that unnecessary objects scattered all over the place distracted players to the point where it actually interfered with the portal training process so we simplified the art style to favor clean focused test chambers the modular approach we settled on makes it look plausible that the chambers can reform dynamically on these pistons
sound/commentary/prtl-comment077.wav=erik wolpaw even though portal tells a simple story we created a lot of backstory for aperture science for its employees for its rivalry with the hated black mesa and for where all of this fits into the cosmology of half life this first portal game doesnt reveal all of it but we crammed a lot of little details into the environments this area for instance called the ratman den hints that there may be other people trapped in the facility
sound/commentary/prtl-comment068.wav=lars jensvold we designed this room to draw the players eyes to the box the light from the observation room casts horizontal shadows that point at the box which is directly lit by a warm light from the ceiling this warm light helps the box stand out against the predominantly cool test chamber lighting the varying sized squares of the off limits surface also help direct the players attention upward
sound/commentary/prtl-comment005.wav=paul graham during development wed often run across some piece of level design that would break the portal system for instance this ceilingtoceiling transition was an unexpected edge case that ended up requiring a lot of effort to make work we tried never to take the easy route of simply changing the level design to work with existing portal technology we knew that once the game was out in the wild custom map creators would stress the system in ways we hadnt even considered so we made it as flexible as possible
sound/commentary/prtl-comment098.wav=kim swift in these new areas we werent using the surfaces the player is familiar with the rules for which new surfaces portals can be placed on and which surfaces are offlimits needed to be taught so we created this area both to show the player they have escaped into the guts of the facility and to retrain them in which surfaces are valid for portal placement
sound/commentary/prtl-comment006.wav=greg coomer an important design goal of these postescape levels was to give players the sense that they were running wild inside the guts of the facility with that in mind we added plenty of nooks and crannies for players to crawl into or place portals through this ended up being a tricky lighting challenge as the areas needed to be bright enough to navigate while still being dim enough to feel like obscure disused sections of the building
sound/commentary/prtl-comment043.wav=jeep barnett originally these scaffolds ran on electrified tracks but crafty playtesters would hop along the rails to the exit bypassing the puzzle entirely we tried to solve this by killing players as soon as they touched the rails that solution ended up being too much of an over correction as even skilled playtesters were getting frustrated by these onehit kills in the more complex puzzles later in the game making the scaffolds run along immaterial beams of light solved both problems
sound/commentary/prtl-comment048.wav=garret rickey portal momentum ended up being the hardest concept to convey for this series of puzzles which went through more design iterations than virtually any other part of the game we introduce the idea of redirecting your momentum using portals slowly step by step we even have the ai voice pretty explicitly explain the elements of the puzzle something we avoided throughout most of the rest of the game
sound/commentary/prtl-comment097.wav=garret rickey we use these moving platforms to add time pressure to puzzles a sequence of simple decisions feels much more climactic under time pressure in contrast to most puzzles in portal which can be solved at the players leisure puzzles that arent time bound can be more complex but at the expense of being less dramatic
sound/commentary/prtl-comment026.wav=kerry davis this room was designed to make players understand that entrance and exit portals arent tied to the color of the portal playtesters often assumed that orange portals were exitonly so we created this puzzle to force players to enter an orange portal
sound/commentary/prtl-comment000.wav=erik wolpaw creating the ai voice was a multistep process first we ran every line of dialog through an automatic texttospeech program in the studio we cued the actress who plays g lados ellen mc clane with the computergenerated sound file shed mimic it and then over the course of several takes adjust her performance to clean up any words that were unintelligible in the computer version for instance heres a line as ellen delivered it once the recording was done we processed all of the dialog to give it an extra computery edge heres that same line as it appears in the game with the pitch constrained pitch modulation suppressed and the formant moved up
sound/commentary/prtl-comment041.wav=paul graham because our test chamber environments were simplified for training purposes we created visual hot spots within the rooms to guide players attention the design is essentially a balance between round objects and sharp objects the sharp objects representing background elements and the round objects such as doors and moveable props comprising our points of visual interest
sound/commentary/prtl-comment106.wav=ellen mc lain voice of g lados in the sound booth youre only connected to the production team by an intercom and they can talk about you and you dont know what theyre saying but you trust that theyre being kind and you know theyll theyll push a button and then theyll say something to me they say a direction no that wasnt right do it again give us three more reads and a lot of time what happens is theyll they would play the computergenerated sound for me on one line and then im supposed to recreate that three times with the director saying ok well you know more sarcastic or more angry or or more irritated so you stand in the booth hour after hour after hour theyre always very nice they let you have water in here and maybe a pencil to take a few notes and of course you want it to be interesting because you want them to hire you again
sound/commentary/prtl-comment001.wav=kim swift we designed the postescape levels to give players brief glimpses of the inner workings of the enrichment center this particular area exposes part of the storage cube distribution system these little vignettes help make this section of the game visually distinct from the testing chambers while reinforcing the idea that players are now behindthescenes
sound/commentary/prtl-comment066.wav=jeep barnett a few playtesters put a portal on the floor here and used the rising stair pit to skip the rest of the puzzle well usually rework a level if playtesters discover a way to bypass chunks of the puzzle too easily but in this and a few other cases where skipping ahead arguably takes more skill than solving the puzzle properly we let the ninja solution stand
sound/commentary/prtl-comment070.wav=garret rickey we noticed through our playtests that many of our players werent aware of the fact that you could place portals while falling since placing portals as you are falling is essential to accomplishing flings and many other portal tricks we implemented this puzzle so that the only way to solve it was to use the midair placement tactic it took numerous iterations and lots of tuning before this consistently played well
sound/commentary/prtl-comment020.wav=garret rickey the combination of the prtldestroying fields which we call fizzlers and the elevators serve a dual purpose they provide a clearly identifiable endpoint for each testchamber while also addressing the more practical problem of how to keep players from portaling across level loads we eventually integrated the fizzlers into several of our puzzle designs
sound/commentary/prtl-comment051.wav=bill van buren originally these exit portal surfaces were static geometry in the final position but playtesters stubbornly refused to look up to find them this is another example of the classic gamedesign problem of coaxing players to look up by putting the portals on moving pistons we were able to start them in a position that players were more likely to see
sound/commentary/prtl-comment002.wav=jeep barnett one bizarre fact of game design is that without some serious prompting players will rarely look up in this case the prompt is a ladder most players will investigate where the ladder goes which is up the ladder actually falls apart as soon as its touched but by then its served its purpose
sound/commentary/prtl-comment016.wav=robin walker portal is effectively an extended player training exercise we spend a huge portion of the game introducing a series of gameplay tools then layering these tools into increasingly difficult puzzles this layering starts here where we train the buttonbox mechanic before introducing the more complicated concept of portals
sound/commentary/prtl-comment036.wav=david kircher for the first few months of development we rendered the views through portals to two offscreen textures this approach was easy to implement and was compatible with a wide range of graphics hardware unfortunately this method was incompatible with antialiasing and consumed a large amount of video memory in order to handle recursive views through several portals because of these disadvantages we switched to a system which renders portal views recursively into the frame buffer with the aid of the stencil buffer to isolate pixels corresponding to a given portal this is a more effective scheme because it is compatible with antialiasing and does not consume any additional video memory for offscreen textures
sound/commentary/prtl-comment095.wav=erik wolpaw before the player escapes the fire pit the ai dialog is all delivered in a computerized monotone after the escape however g lados gets progressively more expressive until by the end shes cycling through a whole mess of emotions the role required an actor capable of mimicking the computergenerated voice while still infusing it with some real character and since we planned to end the game with a song she also needed to have a good singing voice the woman we cast ellen mc clane is a great mimic a terrific actor and a classically trained operatic soprano so that worked out pretty good
sound/commentary/prtl-comment013.wav=jeremy bennett g lados the rogue disk operating system that now runs aperture science went through a bunch of design iterations earlier versions included a floating brain a sprawling spidery mechanism and an upsidedown version of botticellis rise of venus built out of robot parts and wire evenutally we settled on a huge mechanical device with a delicate robotic figure dangling out of it which successfully conveys both g ladoss raw power and her femininity
sound/commentary/prtl-comment024.wav=jason brashill in early versions of this map playtesters would charge down the stairs without noticing what was creating the portals we introduced a mandatory pause in the action what we call a gate to help ensure that players stop and notice the portal gun making a blue portal a particle effect and a loud noise help draw their attention
sound/commentary/prtl-comment074.wav=robin walker perhaps the most important purpose of this final test chamber is to cement the double fling maneuver training for previous flings we employed a visual cue a pushed out a section of wall in preparation for the more freeform behindthescenes levels however we take the training wheels off to proceed players must realize that they can double fling almost anywhere they want to with or without hints
sound/commentary/prtl-comment027.wav=david kircher when rendering the players view through a portal we must render a separate image using a virtual camera which looks out of the opposite portal to obtain a correct image and efficient rendering performance we render only what is visible through the limited field of view of the opposite portal and exclude objects which lie between the virtual camera and the plane of the opposite portal
sound/commentary/prtl-comment057.wav=chris chin player training doesnt always stick especially after the introduction of a big new concept for instance after theyd acquired the fully powered portal device playtesters often forgot about the fling maneuver since its such an important skill this puzzle is designed to reintroduce the idea of flinging
sound/commentary/prtl-comment083.wav=jeep barnett the awful end of the companion cube serves a dual purpose it adds a lot more sinister character to our already pretty sinister ai while simultaneously training players to use the incinerator a key component of the final level the training has a nice dramatic payoff since players later get to avenge the death of their good friend the companion cube by stuffing some of the ais important parts into exactly the same type of incinerator
sound/commentary/prtl-comment008.wav=realm lovejoy breaking this tube gives players a chance to test out their newly trained rocketredirecting and glassbreaking skills in a slightly different context which helps cement the training
sound/commentary/prtl-comment038.wav=randy lundeen to make puzzles deeper than just teleporting to the exit we had to include surfaces that wont hold a portal which are formally introduced here we experimented with several surface designs before we settled on this one whose visual noise and reflectivity make it easy to identify at a distance
sound/commentary/prtl-comment012.wav=jeep barnett this massive turret ambush was originally a lot more massive with turrets that dropped from the ceiling and popped out of surprise hatches in fact for a while it was the games climactic battle through playtesting we learned that this type of pure combat experience didnt really fit with the preceding few hours of player training over several iterations we toned down the combat and made the room more about using portal momentum to fling yourself great distances a skill that playtesters really enjoyed using and thats a key component of what eventually became our final battle
sound/commentary/prtl-comment094.wav=paul graham sometimes little details make a huge difference for instance we had to add the left side to this wall to give players a visual representation of how thick it is without it playtesters frequently thought the hall had just gotten impossibly narrower panicked and stopped making rational decisions
sound/commentary/prtl-comment102.wav=ellen mc lain voice of g lados in the beginning when i came in i was just supposed to recreate the sound of a computergenerated voice just recreate it and thats what i did and there was no emotion involved i just listened to the sound of the computer and i repeated what i heard but as the game continued i was supposed to get more and more emotion into the computer into g lados and she developed into a very sweet passiveaggressive person
sound/commentary/prtl-comment019.wav=realm lovejoy these frostedglass observation rooms make the player feel as if theyre being watched at all times while keeping the identity of these watchers a mystery the rooms serve a practical purpose as well since we often use them as convenient and logical light sources for the test chambers
sound/commentary/prtl-comment056.wav=lars jensvold this room is designed to build anticipation for the big moment when players finally get the fully powered portal gun the puzzle path brings you in a circle around the device so that its virtually always in sight right up until you grab it
sound/commentary/prtl-comment060.wav=kerry davis a problem we came across with virtually any puzzle involving boxes and doors was that players could portal the boxes to the other side of the door thereby trapping themselves in a room with buttons but no boxes we set up special triggers to detect and handle these cases and then added the box delivery tubes to ensure players could always be supplied with the required tools
sound/commentary/prtl-comment018.wav=bay raitt we put the player character in an orange jumpsuit to reinforce the fact that shes a test subject visually the warmer orange colors help her pop out against the colder tones of the environment some playtesters were wondering why she could fall so far without getting hurt the way she would in half life in response we added mechanized heel springs to her lower legs afterwards there was no longer any question about why she could survive such long falls
sound/commentary/prtl-comment007.wav=bill van buren these rocket sentries originally fired lasers we switched from lasers to rockets after we introduced the glassbreaking mechanic mainly because glass shattering in a massive rocket explosion turned out to be a lot more satisfying than glass just slowly being melted by a laser originally they also spoke just like the bullet turrets because players often redirect the rockets with their backs to the turret however a distinct uncluttered sound cue was required the voice simply added too much noise to the rocket redirect mechanic
sound/commentary/prtl-comment072.wav=paul graham this puzzle requires players to redirect an energy ball through multiple portal placements the multiple steps caused many early playtesters to panic and accidentally redirect a ball right into themselves with deadly results we redesigned the test chamber so that portals can only be placed in the top half of the room which solved the problem by generally leaving players out of the balls reach
sound/commentary/prtl-comment084.wav=chet faliszek we designed this hall so that players had to use a box as a shield but many playtesters read it as an avoidtheenergyball timing puzzle and simply left the box behind we solved this in large part by having the ai talk about the box a lot once the dialog went in playtesters went from routinely abandoning the box to never wanting it to leave their side since we werent going to make players lug a box around for the rest of the game we added a scene at the end of the level where players are forced to kill the box
sound/commentary/prtl-comment014.wav=erik wolpaw the fiction behind this red phone is that while g lados was being developed it was somebodys job to sit by it and if it ever looked like the ai was becoming sentient and godlike that person would pick up the phone and call somebody to come help at the point in time where the actual game takes place its become obvious that the aperture science red phone plan didnt work out
sound/commentary/prtl-comment004.wav=garret rickey through playtesting we discovered that fatigue set in if we didnt break up the more complicated deliberately paced puzzles with problems that required the player to perform a much simpler task under time pressure these pistons proved to be a good foundation for that simpler type of puzzle because they feature a moving surface they also gave us an opportunity to employ some unusual portal transitions such as ceilingtoceiling
sound/commentary/prtl-comment054.wav=scott dalton we found that rather than looking into a portal to see where it went playtesters would often leap blindly to their doom in response to this observation the moral of this puzzle is look before you leap the safe orange portal is out of the players view from this balcony that forces them to peer through a portal to see it which trains players in the remoteviewing capabilities of portals
sound/commentary/prtl-comment053.wav=greg coomer using gravity to fall into one portal so that you come rocketing out the other portal a skill we call flinging was another difficult concept to train we designed a specific visual cue a pushed out concrete block above a pit with checkerboard concrete tile to indicate to players that its time to use the fling maneuver repeated several times this cue helps players associate pushed out concrete slabs with flinging in much the same way that players learn to associate cubes with buttons
sound/commentary/prtl-comment104.wav=ellen mc lain voice of g lados sarcasm g lados is sarcastic a lot and thats so much fun but while i was trying to do this trying to build in all these emotions i still had to maintain the computer sound and maintain the pronunciation of repeated phrases you know aperture science and the enrichment center
sound/commentary/prtl-comment101.wav=ellen mc lain voice of g lados i know that i was told that you know sort of the idea of valve is that everything everything is planned everything is worked out in advance but thats a big fat lie because the initial idea is started and they bring an actor into the studio and they say you know say these words for us say this computer generated voice for us okay ill do that well then that gives the creators other ideas and its its a rolling process you roll from one idea into the next idea

sound/commentary/prtl-comment076.wav=chet faliszek for portal we wanted to create a turret that was different from the traditional hl turrets the hl turrets are nothing more than mindless mounted guns in portal we wanted the turrets to have personality to be characters the first step was a redesign of the look once we had the look of the new turrets they seemed less like menacing machine guns and more like cute robots and robots can never really be cute until they are talking robots so the next step was creating the vocal characteristics of the turrets working with ellen mc clain we settled on an innocent sounding voice with dialogue to match this juxtaposition of killing machine and innocent nonaggressive personality ends up making the portal turret a memorable character
sound/commentary/prtl-comment035.wav=david kircher integrating portals with the source engines physics system was a complex process that required several iterations to achieve the right balance of performance and correctness because portals can be placed virtually anywhere in the game environment the physics system had to be modified to allow dynamic changes to its representation of colliding geometry such as the walls and floor around this box and any objects which may lie on the opposite side of the portal initial implementations of this dynamic collision generation system could take up to one half of one second or milliseconds to compute the correct collision this may not sound like a long time in everyday life but this pause during portal creation was quite noticeable in the context of the game ultimately we designed a system that creates temporary hybrid physics environments in bubbles around the portals using less accurate collision than that produced by sources standard collision generation but was accurate enough in practice and reduced the time to create the dynamic collision representation from milliseconds to just milliseconds which is an imperceptible pause during portal creation
sound/commentary/prtl-comment010.wav=randy lundeen originally these catwalks were decorative but playtesters consistently thought they were significant and often spent a lot of time trying to reach them we didnt want to stand between people and their desire to walk on the catwalks so we redesigned the area to make catwalks not only accessible but also necessary to proceed
sound/commentary/prtl-comment059.wav=jeremy bennett when we moved from largely placeholder art to our final visual design this was the first level to get a facelift we chose this map because it had many of our gameplay elements integrated into a relatively small space the test chamber art direction was designed to make everything appear purposefully placed the simple design helps focus players on the puzzles it also provides a nice contrast to the later much less sterile behindthescenes environments which contributes to a clear sense of progression
sound/commentary/prtl-comment069.wav=kim swift this particular section went through several iterations because its the first place where players are required to perform possibly the trickiest portal maneuver the double fling originally the room also featured an energy ball redirection puzzle combined with the new double fling skill however it proved to be too much for most playtesters overwhelmed players tend not to digest new information so we simplified the puzzle to require only the double fling to nudge players in the right direction we also included visual hints such as the previously introduced single fling theme the pushed out concrete slab with a checkerboard landing zone
sound/commentary/prtl-comment022.wav=paul graham we wanted players to feel safe while standing in a portal so we never kill them or destroy objects within a portal thats closing instead we either push or teleport objects out of a portal as it closes
sound/commentary/prtl-comment105.wav=ellen mc lain voice of g lados i went to portals umm i googled portal ingame and i went to the trailer and i just loved it i loved hearing my voice laughter and as i told the production team i have never played a computer game in my life but i want to play this one laughter
sound/commentary/prtl-comment103.wav=ellen mc lain voice of g lados as an actor you know you come in you do what youre told you want to make your money and sometimes you get good direction and sometimes you dont get good direction but it doesnt matter and you certainly dont tell the production team any of this but you come in and theyll you know theyll give you a lame line reading and youre supposed to find some emotional value in that but this is not what this team did they would come in for example and give me the direction explosively indignant thats a wonderful direction for an actor so i must say that the production team won me over because so often i get bogus direction but this time i was actually directed and had fun at all the sessions
sound/commentary/prtl-comment023.wav=robin walker because we very deliberately introduce and train each gameplay concept once players reach this spot were confident that they know what a portal is and roughly how it works early versions of portal let players stumble through the beginning of the game without always understanding what was going on which really compromised teaching new concepts the puzzle you just finished was designed so that stumbling around will virtually always lead to a dead end completing the puzzle requires walking through a minimum of five portals in a specific order this kind of gating in which a solid understanding of key gameplay concepts is required for success helped standardize the learning curve of the game tremendously

sound/vo/aperture_ai/03_part1_entry-1.wav=while safety is one of many enrichment center goals the aperture science high energy pellet seen to the left of the chamber can and has caused permanent disabilities such as vaporization
sound/vo/aperture_ai/02_part1_success-2.wav=as part of a required test protocol we will not monitor the next test chamber you will be entirely on your own good luck

sound/vo/aperture_ai/escape_02_miscbabble-18.wav=what was that did you say something
sound/vo/aperture_ai/13_part1_endnag-2.wav=while it has been a faithful companion your companion cube cannot accompany you through the rest of the test if it could talk and the enrichment center takes this opportunity to remind you that it cannot it would tell you to go on without it because it would rather die in a fire than become a burden to you
sound/vo/aperture_ai/escape_02_spheredestroy4-10.wav=the part of you that could have survived indefinitely is gone i just struck you from the permanent record
